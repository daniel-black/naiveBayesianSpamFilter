We introduced a revolutionary online gaming concept during the 1997 NFL Season known as NetFL, or "Pick Against the Pros". Due to the overwhelming requests we have received over the years, we're back! This year our goal is to bring the cutting edge convenience of the internet to the popular office pools that have swept the nation. www.Sports-OfficePools.com is an online arena for NFL enthusiasts and office pool participants. We make office pools easy with our up-to-the-minute picks and real time stats.

This is not a gambling site. We do not support gambling. This site is for the purpose of maintaining and managing member stats for the NFL season.
