Dear Internet User,

Donate to the American Red Cross to assist in their relief and rescue 
efforts in New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington. NewDomainCentral will 
be donating 100% of proceeds received until October 01, 2001 to the 
American Red Cross. 

Effective October 01, 2001, a new series of email addresses will be 
available to you using the new .BIZ and .INFO domain extensions. In order 
to secure your domain name and protect yourself from unscrupulous 
speculators, we recommend pre-registering your new domain name now. For a 
limited time only, the cost for pre-registration has been waived and you 
will only be
responsible for the pre-authorization fee of $1.00 and the registration 
fees once the domain is secured successfully for you in October. Visit: 
http://www.NewDomainCentral.com now and protect yourself. 
NewDomainCentral.com will be donating 100% of
the proceeds from each pre-authorization to the American Red Cross to 
assist in their relief efforts.

Experts expect up to several million new domain names will be 
registered by internet users worldwide on October 01, 2001 when the new 
extensions are officially released. If you do not pre-register your domain 
name, your chances of success are greatly
diminised since you will be competing with hundreds of thousands of 
internet users trying to flood the servers with their registration 
requests. Why bother waiting in line? Pre-register now at: 
http://www.NewDomainCentral.com and bypass the lineup.

Our servers have been upgraded to handle approximately 50,000 more 
domain names. Once this threshold is reached, we will no longer offer 
pre-registration services to the general public at no cost and will likely 
charge a nominal pre-reg fees as is being
levied by many domain resellers. There is still time, but you must act 
immediately and go to: http://www.NewDomainCentral.com today.
