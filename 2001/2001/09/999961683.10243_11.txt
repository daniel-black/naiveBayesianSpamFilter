<BR>
When you Close a sale is your cut over a thousand dollars?  Five<BR>
thousand? Ten thousand?  More?<BR>
 <BR>
<B>Is it reasonable to think that your product, or service, will appeal<BR>
to fifty people out of a million? (Of course it is)</B><BR>
 <BR>
Let's say if, out of fifty leads, forty are "tire kickers", ten are serious,<BR>
and you close three to five?<BR>
 <BR>
If you closed three to five, and your campaign cost broke even at one<BR>
close - would you do this every day?<BR>
 <BR>
If this is such a "Good Deal" why would I be looking for clients? Truth<BR>
is, I have many clients, but most of them are overwhelmed by the leads they<BR>
receive every time I advertise for them. End result is they are a once a<BR>
month business. If you have the staff to field the leads I can generate,<BR>
 <BR>
<B>Call me at:  888-863-1681 - Leave a message. I will return your call,<BR>
and we can discuss a marketing plan, that makes sense, in today's<BR>
"real world".</B><BR>
 <BR>
The demise of the the "dot com's" have created a vacuum!!  A vacuum that<BR>
will be filled, by the informed, the empowered, the winners!!!<BR>
<BR>
