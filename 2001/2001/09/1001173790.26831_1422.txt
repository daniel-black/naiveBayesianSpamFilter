OTCBB Stock Alert's Last Two Picks:

DICE from $ .49 to $1.62 in 7 days for a GAIN OF OVER 300%!!!

HERE IS OUR NEXT EXPLOSIVE STOCK PICK:
Diversified Product Inspections, Inc. (OTCBB: DPRI)
BUY AT $1.25

MAJOR CONTRACT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND HUGE NEWSLETTER COVERAGE
THIS WEEK FOR DPRI !!!

Revenues for DPRI, a 10-year old, fully-reporting company,
have skyrocketed 600% higher this year to over $8 Million
on substantial US Government and Insurance Industry contracts.
DPRI's client list of over 50 major insurance companies includes
Allstate, Fireman's Fund, Travelers, Liberty Mutual, Prudential,
Hartford, and Nationwide.

We are expecting significant news this week regarding increasing
revenue and contract expansion from DPRI's Fortune 500 customer
base. The stock has already bounced sharply from its 52-week low
and will continue moving up immediately. We think the stock could
easily climb above $4 in less than a month.

WE ARE PROJECTING RECORD VOLUME AND PRICE APPRECIATION AS DPRI MAY
VERY WELL BE ONE OF THE MOST UNDERVALUED STOCKS ON THE OTCBB!!!
