Dear Domain Registrant,

As a savvy internet executive, it is important for you to secure one of the new .BIZ domain name extensions before the pre-registration deadline of September 17, 2001. After this date, you will have to compete with hundreds of thousands of speculators, professionals, students, and novices to maintain the rights to your domain name. 

You can pre-register your .BIZ domain name today at: http://www.dotbizcentral.com, one of the largest and easiest domain registration sites available on the Internet. The site is very popular because it actually credits fees from unsuccessful pre-registration attempts towards future registrations. This means that you do not risk anything by submitting your domain name now. However, if you do not pre-register your domain name, your chances of keeping your domain name under the new extension will be significantly diminished. The worst part is that you may be required to buy your domain name back from a domain speculator for hundreds or thousands of dollars.

"While .com names hold the most prestige, the next frontier is the new suffixes -.info, .biz, and .pro likely to become available later this year..." -BUSINESSWEEK MAGAZINE, April 16, 2001. 

Experts expect several million domain names to be registered in the first days after registration officially opens, making it even more difficult to secure a good name. The best time to act is now...at www.DotBizCentral.com. As the general public becomes aware of these new extensions later this year, registration volumes and values of these names will skyrocket. DotBizCentral.com has the premier pre-registration engine to help you secure the domain you want. Over 320,000 names have already been queued in the system and good names are going fast. Do not wait until the last minute. Go to http://www.DotBizCentral.com now to pre-register.
