Dear Internet User, 

The new .INFO domain extension is scheduled for its official worldwide debut on September 12, 2001. With this highly anticipated launch only weeks away, the domain industry is in high-gear preparing for a surge in demand by offering exclusive pre registration services to internet consumers. At the same time, domain speculators are scrambling to secure the pre-registration rights to hundreds of thousands of domain names hoping to resell the names to trademark holders and rightful owners for an exorbitant markup.
 
If you currently own a domain name ending with a .COM/NET/ORG extension, you must pre-register your new .INFO extension in order to combat speculators and avoid costly legal disputes of ownership. Currently, one of the most popular and easy-to-use pre-registration sites can be found at: <http://www.InfoGrab.net/>

Experts have predicted that introducing new domain extensions to the Internet will increase the supply of attractive domain names but may also result in consumer confusion. In order to protect your identity on the Internet, you need to secure your domain name under the new domain extensions as soon as possible. Visit <http://www.InfoGrab.net/> to find out more today.
