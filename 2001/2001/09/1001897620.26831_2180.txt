READ here to know what you will get
for free:

As an online marketer, there is absolutely no doubt that  you have
been wrongly accused of spamming at some point.  If you've not, you 
will soon be as no one can escape this problem. 


For example, you belong to a safe list like listmaker, or
you host your own FFA page and collect the email addresses of
the people that post their ads on your page.

You have every right to SEND THEM THANK and also send them
reminder about their posting, afterall, you are providing them 
valuable FREE services which they did not pay for. 

Or you are a member of safe-list/opt-in list and you also 
have right to reply to email messages of people sending their
messages to you. 

And after you accumulated a few thousand email addresses, 
you decided to do a mass mailing to remind those people to 
come back and visit your site again.

You do your mailing, and the next thing you know, you lose your 
email account, you lose your web site and in very severe cases 
you may even lose your ISP, all because some bonehead accuses 
you of spamming when in fact you were simply sending a message 
to someone who initially contacted you first or used your free
services!

The way that these people make you lose all of your accounts 
is by the information that you put into your email message to them.

Think about this... In a standard email message you probably put 
your email address, your emailing software will also STAMPED your
SMTP ID #,  your ISP ID # and sometimes you also include your web
site URL and  many of you even put your phone number in the message.  


Once the person who decides to cry "spam" has all of this information, 
a few well placed and very demanding emails to your email provider
and web host could bring your entire business to a screeching halt 
within a matter of hours. 

Now There Is A Solution!

We've put together a series of training manuals, audio video tapes
on responsible mass email marketing and how to protect your business
against flames and complaints. 

Also available include advice and guide on

** the right software to use

*** Do you really need bulk friendly email hosting?
**  Blind copy Email forwarding facilities that can 
    now completely protect your identity, your ISP,
    your website and your business from anti-bulkmailers. 

** VHS VIDEO TAPE: Watch and let experts around the world
   coach you on top secrets and A-Z of mass emailing why 
   you are relaxing on your sofa at home.

Surveys shows that learning Internet Marketing with VHS VIDEO
Tapes, where you listen to real people is more effective than
proliferated ebooks... Corey Rudl use this technique extensively.


*** Plus more, I can't mention everything here

OUR TRAINING KITS ARE REALLY MORE THAN FREE TRIALS
AND WILL GET YOU STARTED IN NO TIME...that is if you request 
for them.
