Are you tired of reading all those crappy ads that promise that you'll get 
rich in a week with no work involved ? In most cases, the person that 
posted it tells you anything you want to hear in order to gain referrals for 
themselves. And I'll tell ya, in most cases, they themselves are not making 
what they promise that you can make. And once you sign up, forget about 
it. They got their referral and they are not too interested in helping you out. 
 
    Please allow me to tell you about a fabulous business opportunity. It 
requires some work, and no, you won't be rich in a week. However, it is 
free to join, and there is no experience required. I have been involved 
with this business for 9 months and at the current time I make around 
$900 per month. No, I am not rich but at least now I can stay home, 
spend time with my family, and do things I like to do. I work hard everyday 
to make that figure rise, and I want to help you do it too ! I offer one on 
one support and don't abandon you once your name appears in my 
mailbox. If you don't succeed, then neither do I. At the current moment, 
we have 3.1 million people in over 190 different countries ! Those kind of 
numbers are proof that our opportunity is an honest, reputable one.
