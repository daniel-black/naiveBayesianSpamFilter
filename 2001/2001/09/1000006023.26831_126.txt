"Alpha del Bosque has a supreme understanding of
the logic and psychology of
mini-sites.
Her superb report 'Killer Mini Sites' is indispensable if you've been considering 
using this strategy in your Internet marketing. She makes a fairly complex 
topic very easy to understand, and the book is even enjoyable and great to 
*look* at!"

- Mark Joyner
CEO, Aesop.com 

"What a great idea! While everyone else is losing money on mega-websites, along 
comes Alpha with the brilliant idea of selling information on mini-sites!
I love it! Get this one! It reads like a breeze and works like a charm!"

- Joe Vitale, author of "Hypnotic Writing,"
"Spiritual Marketing," and numerous other books
www.MrFire.com 

"I have to admit that I was very impressed with your report. The information 
was literally dead-on and presents the exact method by which I personally run 
my own online business. Killer Mini-Sites are THE way to go -no doubt
(I have a bank account packed with money to prove it).
The bottom line is: For anyone who accesses and actually implements the suggestions 
you so clearly outline, they are guaranteed a faster, proven and more reliable 
system for producing an income online -- no matter who they are.
Outstanding work!!"

- Chayden A. Bates
The effective marketing group
http://MarketingEffect.com/ 

"Alpha, simply put: Your new report is brilliant! You have managed to break 
down every little detail in the process of creating mini-sites that work.
'Killer mini-sites' should be required reading to anyone trying to make money 
online. After all, they *will* be making hard sounding cash once they start 
using your principles.
And to top it all off, the report is eye-candy! Two thumbs up!
In my opinion, your report is: 'The e-book of the year'!"
