      and Natural Gas expansion in U.S. History. Demand for Energy is at its 
      highest level putting tremendous pressure on Scientific &amp; Technical

      energy industry with the need for more power plants and cheaper fuel. CBYI 
      is a major benefactor of this growing need because it supplies specialized 
      "Smell Technology" analyzers for industrial applications in Natural Gas 
      production and transmission.</P>
