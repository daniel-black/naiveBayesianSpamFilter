OTCBB Stock Alert's Last Two Picks:
EMRG from $ .60 to $2.50 in 10 days for a GAIN OF OVER 400%!!!
DICE from $ .49 to $1.62 in 7 days for a GAIN OF OVER 300%!!!

HERE IS OUR NEXT EXPLOSIVE STOCK PICK:
Diversified Product Inspections, Inc. (OTCBB: DPRI)
BUY AT $1.25
SELL TARGET $4.60 3D DIAMOND PLAY !!!!

MAJOR CONTRACT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND HUGE NEWSLETTER COVERAGE
THIS WEEK FOR  DPRI !!!

Revenues for DPRI, a 10-year old, fully-reporting company, have  
skyrocketed 600% higher this year to over $8 Million on substantial US 
Government and Insurance Industry contracts. DPRI's client list of over 
50 major insurance companies includes Allstate, Fireman's Fund, 
Travelers, Liberty Mutual, Prudential, Hartford, and Nationwide.

We are expecting significant news this week regarding increasing revenue 
and contract expansion from DPRI's Fortune 500 customer base. The stock 
has already bounced sharply from its 52-week low and will continue 
moving up immediately. We think the stock could easily climb above $4 in 
less than a month.

WE ARE PROJECTING RECORD VOLUME AND PRICE APPRECIATION AS DPRI MAY VERY 
WELL BE ONE OF THE MOST UNDERVALUED STOCKS ON THE OTCBB!!!
