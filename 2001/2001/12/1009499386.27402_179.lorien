Hi There! <br>
My name is Kathy, I'm trying to put my self <BR>
though school so my girlfriends and I decided <BR>
to put up a web site featuring my friends and I<BR>
doing all sorts of nasty little things with each other<BR>
and the campus guys! My favorite past time is giving head<br>
and you can see me right on the front page of the site<br>
BTW I'm the blonde in the bottom right hand corner<br>
