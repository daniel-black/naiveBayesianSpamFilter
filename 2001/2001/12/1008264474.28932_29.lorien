MAJOR CONTRACT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND HUGE NEWSLETTER
COVERAGE FOR VOLT!

VOLT will be profiled by some Major Newsletters along
with the release of significant News regarding explosive
sales for the Company.  There will be huge volume and a
strong increase in price for several days.  The same
newsletters that profiled MCTR will begin coverage on
VOLT.  They brought MCTR from $ 1.35 to $8.50!  We know
for certain that the same groups are going to feature
VOLT and even better returns are expected.

We are very proud that we can share this information
with you so that you can make a profit out of it.  It
is highly advisable to take a position in VOLT as soon
as possible, today before the market closes, or tomorrow.

As a provider of alternative energy and back-up power
systems, VOLT's assets jumped over 2,000% this year
to $5.8 Million along with solid net income versus a loss
in the previous year.  With these type of numbers and news
of contractual developments, we anticipate huge volume,
rapid analyst coverage, and broker participation.

WE ARE HEARING STRONG RUMORS OF AN UPCOMING STOCK SPLIT.

The stock has built a solid base at its current level and
will start moving up immediately.  We think the stock can
easily reach $10.00 in less than a month.

Good luck and watch VOLT fly this week!
