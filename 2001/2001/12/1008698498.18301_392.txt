 time 
      Stockplay sent out a profile on Nu Electric was in May of this year.=
 In a 
      few days, the stock more then tripled, rising from .56 to 1.89. NRGE=
 has 
      now drifted back to the same price level that has proven to be an 
      excellent support area many times over the years. Looking at the 3 y=
ear 
      stock chart, (see below) we see that NRGE went from 50 cents to $2.0=
0 in 
      the spring of 1999, and went from under .50 to 2.75 a few months lat=
er, 
      and then rallied a third time after our recent write-up.</font></p>

e, the 
      fundamental news has improved for the company. On October 31, the 
      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that they would acce=
pt a 
      new tougher arsenic standard for drinking water. Nu Electric's Clean=
 Water 
      Technologies division has licensed a patented process to remove arse=
nic 
      that was developed at the University of South Florida (USF). This pa=
st 
      Friday, NRGE announced that they had paid their first royalty check =
to USF 
      to continue their relationship. </font></p>
      <p align=3D"justify"><font face=3D"Arial" color=3D"#000080">It is al=
so positive 
      that NRGE has a small number of outstanding shares, with a tiny floa=
t of 
      only 1.4 million. The company has 
      no debt, insiders own about 40%, and they are an SEC reporting 
      company. In addition to the Clean Water buyout, (in 1999) they also 
      acquired Zorax, Inc., which has a patent-pending technology develope=
d at 
      Johns Hopkins University to extract cryptosporidium and giardia from=
 
      drinking water.  </font></p>
      <p align=3D"justify"><font face=3D"Arial" color=3D"#000080">The stoc=
k market plunge that followed the September 11th 
      trading halt brought prices down to their lows for the year. Now tha=
