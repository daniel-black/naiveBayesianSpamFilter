Dear Good Samaritan,

As a good humane, you know, there are needy and the poor and the =
helpless and the godforsaken who need all the help that we, the =
fortunate ones can muster. A simple gesture, a token of affection from =
you can bring a smile on some unknown face rekindling the hope in the =
innate goodness of human nature.

Please spare a moment and visit www.sambhavonline.org to see how you can =
make a difference. Sometimes, you can also save a life in a country like =
India where several souls succumb to even starvation deaths.

God bless,
Krishna
