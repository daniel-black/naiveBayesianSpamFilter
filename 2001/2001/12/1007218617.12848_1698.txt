Dear Sir,
REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction. This is by virtue of its nature as being 
utterly confidential and classified. I got your e-mail address from an internet listing, as I will 
want to 
immediately put your mind to rest in that regard. I therefore must apologise for infringing on 
your privacy. 

We are top officials of the Federal Government Contract Review Panel, and due to our very 
membership of this panel, we are privy to the information I am about to revealed to you in 
trust and 
confidence as obtains in the urgent business relationship we seek, wherein the principle of 
uberrima fidei can never be ignored. We nevertheless, crave your indulgence for total 
confidentiality. 
 
We are interested in the importation of goods into our country with funds, which are 
presently trapped in this same country, Nigeria. In order to commence this business, we 
solicit your 
assistance in the area of FREEING the said trapped funds and ultimately, your RECIEPT 
and CUSTODIAN of these funds ABROAD.

Explicitly, the source of this fund is as follows: During the regime of our late head of state, 
Gen. Sani Abacha, the then Government officials set up private companies and lobbied the 
award of 
contracts to their companies, these contract were grossly over-invoiced in various 
Ministries. Fortunately, the NEW CIVILIAN Government set up a Contract Review Panel 
(C.R.P) where we 
hold exalted designations and we have successfully identified several inflated contract 
funds, which are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria (C.B.N). We desire to 
release a 
particular contract fund from the very several, but due to our position as civil servants and 
members of this panel, we cannot acquire this fund in our names and without a much 
needed foreign 
assistance. I have therefore been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues to source 
for an overseas partner INTO whose ACCOUNT the sum of US$31,000,000.00 (Thirty-one 
Million United States Dollars) being the contract funds of this particular contract WILL BE 
PAID BY TELEGRAPHIC TRANSFER, hence this written request.

We propose a sharing ratio upon the success of this transaction as thus:
1. 	70% for us (the officials)
2. 	20% for the FOREIGN PARTNER (you)
3. 	10% to be used in settling taxation and all local and foreign expenses       incurred 
during the course of this transaction.

It is from this 70% that we wish to undertake the procurement and importation business. 
Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and we hope THAT THE FUNDS CAN 
ARRIVE YOUR 
ACCOUNT within ten (10) banking days from the date of our receipt of your following details 
on TEL/FAX: 234-1-7747907: 
A SUITABLE NAME AND A CORRESPONDING BANK ACCOUNT INTO WHICH THE 
FUNDS CAN BE PAID.

The above information will enable us write letters of claim and job description respectively. 
This way we will use your company's name (or as applicable) to prepare the necessary 
documentary 
foundation and apply for payments and re-award the contract in your company name.

We are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your confidentiality in this 
transaction.

Please acknowledge receipt of this letter using either of the following:
Tel/Fax number: 234 1 7747907.

I will bring you into the complete picture of this pending project when I have heard from you.

Yours Faithfully,
Dr. Ojo  Adams.
