Now is the perfect time to reserve your firstname.lastname.name before someone else takes it. The final deadline for .name pre-submissions is 12 noon PST on Monday, December 17, 2001. Go to http://www.namesforeveryone.com now.

Why register my .NAME?
Easy-to-remember
Personalized with your own name
Permanent online identity
Globally recognized
 
"In the near future, a .NAME address could even serve as your cell phone number and  your online identity to handle money transfers!"  Andrew Tsia, CEO of Global Name Registry 

It's the most personalized domain that is currently offered on the Internet.  For example, if your name is John Smith, you can reserve John.Smith.name as well as get your personalized email  John@Smith.name.  Use it to create your own personal website for posting pictures, hobbies, interests, or even resumes. You can also replace a hard to remember email address like yourname45@mail99.com with your firstname@lastname.name.  Your name will never change, so why not pre-register now before someone else does? The uses for your .NAME are endless! 

Hurry and reserve your .NAME now as these unique domains are awarded on a first come first served basis.  Pre-register your own .NAME for only US$10 per domain at http://www.namesforeveryone.com and be the first to own YOUR .NAME.
