Dear website resposible,

With the rollout of the Internet Explorer 6.0 more and more users can adjust the privacy-level in their browsers. That gi=
ves you a hard time sending cookies because all of your IE6.0 customers will not allow this anymore. But there is a solut=
ion:
Simply publish a p3p privacy policy on your site and all the browsers will accept your cookies.

P3P is a official standard by w3.org. P3P was developed for users to gain more control over the use of personal informati=
on on Web sites they visit. Microsoft has integrated this feature in the Internet Explorer 6.0.

We have developed a p3p editor that will allow you to create and publish a p3p compliant privacy policy within minutes. P=
lease check our web site www.p3peditor.com and get you a free copy of the trial version of our p3p editor.

For further information please visit: www.w3.org/p3p or www.p3peditor.com

Kind regards
P3P Team

If you don=92t like to receive further information please send an email to:
