Dear Sir/Madam, 

BFSONLINE.COM $675 US 

I have recently acquired the rights to the above domain name on behalf of
a client.  My client has since decided not to proceed with his venture.  I
am therefore, writing to any person and/or company who may have an
interest in this domain name.

If you have an interest in acquiring this domain, please contact me at
your earliest convenience.

All transactions are 100% secure and are transacted with the largest
e-commerce company on the net. The transfer process is extremely simple
and you can also be confident that with Namegiant.com, you are dealing
with a reputable company and will receive all the assistance and support
that you may require throughout any transfer process - and beyond. 

If this email is of no interest, I apologize for this intrusion and can
assure you you will not be mailed again. This is a one-off approach
because we felt this development could be of genuine interest to you and
your company.

Kind regards, 

Stuart
