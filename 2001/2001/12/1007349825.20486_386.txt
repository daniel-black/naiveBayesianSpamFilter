  =============MORE TESTIMONIALS=============== 

  '' My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.  When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had 
 received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total  $ 147,200.00  ........ all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''.                                                     Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois 
  ================================================ 
'' Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big''.                              Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada 
  ================================================= 
'' I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the 
  money came within 22 weeks''.                                                           Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. 
  ================================================= 
 
'' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $ 20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $ 362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet''.

In These Trying Times I Send this Letter to you along with a Prayer for Peace from my Guardian Angel Stephanie and me!  



"Parents of 15 year old boy find CASH in closet"



Does this headline look familiar? It probably does. You most likely have seen this story featured recently on a major nightly news program (USA).

His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her son's closet.  Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds- all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. "My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", says the 41-year-old woman, "There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag- that's more than my husband earns in a year."



The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she'd 

discovered. He came home right away and they drove together to the boy's school and picked him up.

Little did they suspect that where the money came from was as surprising as actually finding it in the closet.



As it turns out, the boy had been sending out via e-mail on the Internet what looked like a type of chain-letter to e-mail addresses that he obtained off of the Internet.   Everyday after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom.



"I just got the I-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name on it like the instructions 

said and I started sending it out", says the clever 15-year-old.



The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send five $5 dollar bills to the people on the list, then delete the bottom address and move the other 4 addresses down, and finally to add your name to the top of the list. The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in 5$ dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list.   "I get junk E-mail all the time, and I really didn't think it was gonna work", the boy continues.

Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 dollar bills. "About a week later I rode (my bike) down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelopes stuffed in it. There was a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the (post office) counter-I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)". He goes on, "I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack 'cause I couldn't carry it all."  Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail. "The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, I barely had time for my homework". He had also been riding his bike to several of the area's banks and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties and hundreds. "I didn't want the banks to get suspicious, so I kept rid

g to different banks with 

like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money) and he was outside waiting for me.  One time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she wouldn't be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next bank down the street."  

Actually, the boy didn't have any reason to be afraid.  The reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called 'chain-letter' the boy was sending out and found that it wasn't a chain-letter at all. In fact, it was completely legal complying with US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the cod of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which states a product or service must be exchanged for money received.  Every five dollar bill that he received was exchanged for the valuable reports he sent out via e-mail. This simple process made the letter legal because he was exchanging a product (sending a valuable report via e-mail) to each for a five dollar fee. 

Below is the letter used to promote these valuable Internet reports!   Use it to start your own home-based information business.  The reports will describe how to participate in this program.   And they will educate you about other aspects of the Internet.

 

  






Dear Future Millionaire: 







I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! - follow what it  says to the letter - and you will not worry whether a RECESSION is coming  or not, who is President, or whether you keep your current job or not. Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded to one of these before either. One day though, something just said "you throw away $25.00 going to a movie for 2 hours with your wife". "What the heck." Believe me, no matter where you believe "those feelings" come from, I thank goodness every day that I had that feeling.   I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing had I not. Read on.  It's true. Every  word of it. It is legal. I checked.  Simply because you are buying and selling something of value.

 Making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home. 



 TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET !   

 

  

BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! 

Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. 



Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can "follow the simple instruction" they are bound to make some mega bucks with only 

$25 out of pocket cost''.  DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY   WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. 



 This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable opportunity". I   was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad   I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received a total $ 610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''. 

                                                        Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. 

  

 

Another said: "This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made  $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.''

                                                                       John Ericson, Devner Colorado

  **** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. 

Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture 

going: 

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY   

 

 

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each.  Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%).  Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. 



With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.   Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.  Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. 



Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 5 million e-mail sent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. 



Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5. 



THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million dollars). 



Your total incom for this example:

Report 1 Report 2 Report 3 Report 4 Report 5 

$50 $500 $5,000 $50,000 $500,000 

Grand Total = $555,550 





NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY! 

 

  

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more?  There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting, with  thousands more 

coming on line every day. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! 



METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET   

 

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1and add METHOD #2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. 



This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report. 



  ===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== 

The reason for the "cash" is not because this is illegal or somehow "wrong". It is simply about time. Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you. 



ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.
