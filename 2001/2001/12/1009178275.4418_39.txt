Dear Good Samaritan,
=20
As a good humane, you know, there are needy and the poor and the
helpless and the godforsaken who need all the help that we, the
fortunate ones can muster. A simple gesture, a token of affection from
you can bring a smile on some unknown face rekindling the hope in the
innate goodness of human nature.
=20
Please spare a moment and visit  www.sambhavonline.org
<http://www.sambhavonline.org>  to see how you can make a difference.
Sometimes, you can also save a life in a country like India where
several souls succumb to even starvation deaths.
=20
God bless,
Krishna
