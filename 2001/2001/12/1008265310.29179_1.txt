          <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000080 size=2>The following is 
          BioProtectAmerica's Top 5 List of why Colas and every other soft drink 
          can hardly be considered nutritious and why, in fact, sodas may very 
          well be one of the <I>worst</I> "foods" ever 
          invented!&nbsp;</FONT></P><FONT face=Arial color=#000080 
          size=2>1)&nbsp; Soft drinks contain approximately 1 teaspoon of sugar 
          <B>PER OUNCE</B>, which means 12 whole teaspoons of sugar per average 
          size drink. The typical American consumes <B>54 GALLONS</B> of soda 
          per year. This converts to 41,472 teaspoons of sugar per person per 
          year from the consumption of soft drinks alone! It is common knowledge 
          that too much sugar can contribute to diabetes, heart disease, cancer 
          of the bowel, kidney stones, obesity, and dental decay.</FONT> 
          <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000080 size=2>2)<B>&nbsp; Who's killing 
          Who? </B>Artificial sweeteners have become the alternative to sugar in 
          many products but especially in soft drinks. One such alternative was 
          once considered by the military for possible use as a battlefield 
          neurotoxin! One can of diet soda can depress your immune system by 
          some 50% for as long as 6 hours.&nbsp; How many diet sodas do 
          <I>you</I> drink per day?</FONT> 
          <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000080 size=2>3)&nbsp; Colas, which contain 
          phosphoric acid, leach calcium and other essential minerals out of the 
          body at an astounding rate. Your body can survive without vitamins, 
          but it cannot survive without minerals.&nbsp; It takes 32 glasses of 
          water to flush the acid from 1 can of soda out of your system! In 
          addition, sugar alone will increase the normal rate of mineral loss in 
          sweat and bodily waste by 300% for 12 hours.&nbsp; The end result is 
          that we get sick more often and recovery takes longer. Cancer, 
          diabetes, and acid reflux are all diseases caused by excess body 
          acid.</FONT>

          size=2>4)&nbsp; Soft drinks have replaced water as the most popular 
          method of quenching thirst.&nbsp; The number one trigger of daytime 
          fatigue is lack of water. The caffeine, sugar, and carbon dioxide in 
          soft drinks facilitate dehydration -&nbsp; 75% of all Americans are 
          chronically dehydrated and the majority of asthma cases, along with a 
          whole host of other diseases, are really misdiagnosed cases of chronic 
          dehydration.</FONT> 
          <P><FONT face=Arial color=#000080 size=2>5)&nbsp; Soft drink cans are 
          coated inside with plastic but the phosphoric acid still causes 
          aluminum to leach through into the beverage. Aluminum tends to deposit 
          in the brain and bone tissue and is a well-known potential contributor 
          to Alzheimer's disease.&nbsp;</FONT>
