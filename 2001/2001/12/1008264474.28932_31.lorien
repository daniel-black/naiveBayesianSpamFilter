sales for the Company.  There will be huge volume and a
strong increase in price for several days.  The same
newsletters that profiled MCTR will begin coverage on

is highly advisable to take a position in VOLT as soon

As a provider of alternative energy and back-up power
systems, VOLT's assets jumped over 2,000% this year
to $5.8 Million along with solid net income versus a loss
in the previous year.  With these type of numbers and news
of contractual developments, we anticipate huge volume,
rapid analyst coverage, and broker participation.

WE ARE HEARING STRONG RUMORS OF AN UPCOMING STOCK SPLIT.

The stock has built a solid base at its current level and
will start moving up immediately.  We think the stock can
easily reach $10.00 in less than a month.

Good luck and watch VOLT fly this week!
