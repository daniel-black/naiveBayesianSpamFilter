Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter =
you have been
hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter =
on the Internet,
a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the =
investigation
of this program described below, to see if it really can make people =
money. The
show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.

Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO =
Laws prohibiting
the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple =
instructions,
they are bound to make some mega bucks with only$25 out of pocket =
cost''.
DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS
PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.

This is what one had to say: ''Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I =
was approached
many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally =
joined just to see
what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money =
required. To my
astonishment, I received a total of $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money =
still coming in.

Here is another testimonial: "This program has been around for a long =
time but I never
believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I =
decided to gamble
my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and voila ..... 3 =
weeks later the money
started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 =
months after that
I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by =
re-entering the program,
I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to =
success in this
program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.''

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily =
and comfortably,
please read the following.................THEN READ IT AGAIN and =
AGAIN!!!
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS
WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS:

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DOrder all 5 reports shown on the list below =
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU
ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears
ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON
YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.

=3D=3D=3D When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 =
reports. You will
need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and =
resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=3D$25.00.

Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports =
from these 5 different
individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for =
you to send to
the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy =
of these reports
and keep them on your desk in case something happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to =
each report,
or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed =
below in step
'' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on majority of your profits. =
Once you understand the way
this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. =
Remember, this method
has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People have =
tried to put their
friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the =
money. But it does not work
this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing =
happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you =
do, it will not work for you.

Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!

1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and =
REMOVE the
       name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made =
it through
       the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE =
MAKE SURE
       you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!

it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To =
assist you with marketing
your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide =
you with invaluable
marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, =
where to find thousands
of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to =
get this venture going:
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and =
we will assume You and
those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that =
the mailing receive
only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just =
say it is only 0.2%.
Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of =
only 5,000 each).
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a =
0.2% response, that
is only 10 orders for report # 1. =20

Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail
each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% =
responded with orders.
That's=3D100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 =
e-mails. The 0.2%
response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million =
e-mails sent out.
The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for report #4. Those 10,000 =
people send out
5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The =
0.2% response to that
is 100,000 orders for Report # 5.=20

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=3D$500,000.00 (half million).

Your total income in this example is:
1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4 . $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 =
........ Grand Total=3D$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST
POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT,
YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY !

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT
OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if =
everyone
or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or =
more? There are over
150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, =
many people will do
just that, and more! METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds =
of FREE places to
advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a =
larger response. We strongly
suggest you start with Method # 1 and METHOD # 2 as you go along. For =
every $5 you receive,
all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. =
Always provide same day service
on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with =
your name and address on
it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive =
the report.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D AVAILABLE REPORTS =
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send
