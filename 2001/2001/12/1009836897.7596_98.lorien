Minister Charles Simpson has the power to make you a LEGALLY ORDAINED MINISTER within 48 hours!!!!                             s_26      

BE ORDAINED NOW!

As a minister, you will be authorized to perform the rites and ceremonies of the church!!

WEDDINGS
MARRY your BROTHER, SISTER, or your BEST FRIEND!!
Don't settle for being the BEST MAN OR BRIDES' MAID
Most states require that you register your certificate (THAT WE SEND YOU) with the state prior to conducting the ceremony.

FUNERALS
A very hard time for you and your family
Don't settle for a minister you don't know!!
Most states require that you register your certificate (THAT WE SEND YOU) with the state prior to conducting the ceremony.

BAPTISMS
You can say "WELCOME TO THE WORLD!!!! I AM YOUR MINISTER AND YOUR UNCLE!!"
What a special way to welcome a child of God.

FORGIVENESS OF SINS
The Catholic Church has practiced the forgiveness of sins for centuries
**Forgiveness of Sins is granted to all who ask in sincerity and willingness to change for the better!!

VISIT CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES
Since you will be a Certified Minister, you can visit others in need!!
Preach the Word of God to those who have strayed from the flock

WANT TO START YOUR OWN CHURCH??
After your LEGAL ORDINATION, you may start your own congregation!!


At this point you must be wondering how much the Certificate costs.  Right?  Well, let's talk about how much the program is worth.  Considering the value of becoming a CERTIFIED MINISTER I'd say the program is easily worth $100.  Wouldn't you agree?  However, it won't cost that much.  Not even close!  My goal is to make this life changing program affordable so average folks can benefit from the power of it.
            
Since I know how much you want to help others, you're going to receive your Minister Certification for under $100.00... Not even $50.00...  You are going to receive the entire life-changing course for only $29.95.
