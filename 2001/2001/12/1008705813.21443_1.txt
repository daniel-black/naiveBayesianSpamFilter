This Beautiful Heart Shaped Rare Germ Stone 24K silver plated bracelet
will be yours Free! 	
 Feel The Benefit Of Magnetic Therapy! 

This attractive Heart Shaped Rare Germ Stone Stubed in 24K silver plated
bracelet is embedded with powerful 1,800 + gauss magnets. 

Many studies have shown that magnets may be an effective, non-invasive,
drug-free way to help reduce pain, to help increase flexibility and
promote the body's own natural healing process. This newly designed
bracelet feature deep penetrating uni-pole magnets. This type of magnet
is believed to provide the superior results compared to the bi-polar
magnets often used in other brands.

Magnetic therapy is a natural, non-invasive way to relieve the
discomfort associated with the rigors of daily life. Bracelets are
popular among professional athletes as therapy for aches and stiffness.
Lightweight designed to be worn by both men and women. 

This bracelet comes in either 7 1/2" or 8 1/2" long. It is packaged in a
beautiful Velvet Pouch for you to store when not in use 	
 
	
How Does Magnetic Therapy Work?

Ions in the blood carry either a positive or negative charge. As they
pass through a magnetic field they are either attracted or repelled
which causes them to accelerate. The ions push against the vessel walls
dilating, or opening them, allowing increased blood flow. Heat is
generated by this increase in motion and enhances circulation. Oxidation
is a by-product of ion collisions which carries toxins away from the
damaged area so that it may be filtered. Energized and oxygenated blood
cells help heal the damaged tissue.
