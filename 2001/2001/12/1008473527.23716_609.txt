$$$"TRUE STORY" SEEN ON ABC's 20-20 "BOY 15 MAKES 71
THOUSAND IN 5 WKS!!! YOU CAN TO!!"

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: THIS IS THE ONE!

Parents of 15-year-old find $71,000 cash hidden in his
closet=2E

Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does=2E
You most likely have just seen this story recently
featured on a major nightly news program (USA)=2E


His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when
she came across a large brown paper bag that was
suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a
skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons
closet=2E Nothing could have prepared her for the shock
she got when she opened the bag and found it was full
of cash=2E Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and
hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles=2E


"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", says
the 41-year-old woman, "There was over $71,000 dollars
in that bag -- that's more than my husband earns in a
year"=2E

The woman immediately called her husband at the
car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she
had discovered=2E He came home right away and they drove
together to the boys school and picked him up=2E Little
did they suspect that where the money came from was
more shocking than actually finding it in the closet=2E

As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via
E-mail, a type of "Report" to E-mail addresses that he
obtained off of the Internet=2E Everyday after school
for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on
his computer in his bedroom=2E

"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the
heck, I put my name on it like the instructions said
and I started sending it out", says the clever
15-year-old=2E

The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained
instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person
on the list, then delete the address at the top and
move the others addresses down , and finally to add
your name to the top of the list=2E

The letter goes on to state that you would receive
several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2
weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the
top of the 5-address list=2E "I get junk E-mail all the
time, and really did not think it was going to work",
the boy continues=2E

Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail,
the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him
for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to
fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing
$5 bills=2E

"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post
office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300
envelops stuffed in it=2E There was also a yellow slip
that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter=2E
I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)"=2E He
goes on, "I went up to the counter and they had a
whole box of more mail for me=2EI had to ride back home
and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it
all"=2E

Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out
the E-mail=2E"The money just kept coming in and I just
kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, barely
had time for my homework"=2E He had also been riding his
bike to several of the banks in his area and
exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties and
hundreds=2E

"I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept
riding to different banks with like five thousand at a
time in my backpack=2E I would usually tell the lady at
the bank counter that my dad had sent me in [to
exchange the money] and he was outside waiting for
me=2E One time the lady gave me a really strange look
and
told me that she would not be able to do it for me and
my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just
rode to the next bank down the street (laughs)=2E"

Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be
afraid=2E The reporting news team examined and
investigated the so-called "chain-letter" the boy was
sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter
at all=2E In fact, it was completely legal according to
US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and
1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also
in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16,
Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service
must be exchanged for money received=2E

Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a
little note that read, "Please send me report number
XYX"=2EThis simple note made the letter legal because he
was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a
five-dollar fee=2E

Here is the letter that the 15-year-old was sending
out by E-mail, you can do the exact same thing he was
doing, simply by following the instructions in this
letter=2E

To assist you with marketing your business on the
internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you
with invaluable marketing information which
includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to
find thousands of free classified ads and much more=2E

There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:
METHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D



Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each=2E Let's also
assume that the mailing receive only a 0=2E2% response
(the response could be much better but lets just say
it is only 0=2E2%=2E Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only
5,000 each)=2E

Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000
e-mails=2E With a 0=2E2% response, that is only 10 orders
for report # 1=2E Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of
50,000=2E Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0=2E2%
responded with orders=2E That's=3D100 people responded and
ordered Report # 2=2E Those 100 people mail out 5,000
e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails=2E
The 0=2E2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #
3=2E Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out=2E The 0=2E2% response
to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4=2E
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 50,000(50 million) e-mails=2E The 0=2E2% response
to that is 100,000 orders for Report
# 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=3D$500,000=2E00
(half million)=2E

Your total income in this example is:
1=2E=2E=2E=2E=2E $50 +
2=2E=2E=2E=2E=2E $500 +
3=2E=2E=2E=2E=2E $5,000 +
4=2E=2E=2E=2E=2E $50,000 +
5=2E=2E=2E=2E=2E $500,000
Grand Total=3D$555,550=2E00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE=2E GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE
OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU
CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY !

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D



REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO=2E
Dare to think for a moment what would happen if
everyone or half or even one 4th of those people
mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? There are
over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and
counting=2E Believe me, many people will do just that,
and more!
METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Advertising on the net is very inexpensive and there
are hundreds of FREE places to advertise=2E Placing a
lot of free ads on the Internet will
easily get a larger response=2E We strongly suggest you
start with Method # 1 and METHOD # 2 as you go along=2E

must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered=2E That's

with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they can not advertise until they receive the
report=2E
