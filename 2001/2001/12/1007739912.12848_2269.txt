DEAR SIR,
I PRAY THIS IMPORTANT MESSAGE MEETS YOU IN PEACE, MAY
BLESSINGS OF GOD BE UPON YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND GRANT
YOU THE WISDOM TO UNDERSTAND MY SITUATIONS AND HOW
MUCH I REALLY NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE.

BEFORE I START LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF MY NAME IS MRS.
MARIAM ABACHA THE WIFE OF THE LATE AND FORMER HEAD OF
STATE OF NIGERIA GENERAL SANNI ABACHA.SINCE THE
(STRANGE AND UNFORTUNATE) DEATH OF MY HUSBAND (MAY
GOD’S MERCY BE UPON HIM), THE GOVERNMENT HAS TURNED
AGAINST MY FAMILY WITH STRANGE ACCUSATION.AT FIRST I
THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE VENDETTA FROM MY HUSBAND’S
ENEMIES BUT I WAS WRONG.THEY ARRESTED MY ONLY SON OLD
ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF THE FAMILY AND THEN THEY FROZE
ALL OUR BANK ACCOUNTS KNOWN TO THEM, HOPING THAT WE
WILL STARVE TO DEATH.  WHY CAN’T WE ALL LIVE IN PEACE?
SINCE I CAN’T DO ANYTHING IN MY POSITION HERE, THIS IS
WHERE YOU COME IN.

MY FAMILY IS GOING THROUGH HARDSHIP, MY SON IS IN JAIL
AND THE REMAINING ONES AND MYSELF ARE UNDER HOUSE
ARREST. THE NEW DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT
OLUSEGUN OBANSANJO HAS SEIZED MORE THAN US$88 MILLION
DOLLARS ALREADY AND THEY ARE  STILL SEIZING A LOT OF
LAND AND PROPERTY. ALL THAT IS REMAINING NOW IS
US$42MILLION DOLLARS, AND THIS MONEY HAS BEEN KEPT IN
A PLACE I CANNOT DISCLOSE, UNTIL WE MAKE PERSONAL
CONTACT.WE CANNOT TOUCH THIS MONEY IN NIGERIA FOR YOU
KNOW WE ARE UNDER HOUSE ARREST AND ARE BEING SERIOUSLY
WATCHED BY THE GOVERNMENT. SO AFTER DISCUSSING WITH MY
SON, THIS IS WHAT WE PLAN TO DO WITH THE MONEY, WE
PLAN TO SEND IT  TO YOUR COUNTRY USING A VERY POPULAR
DIPLOMATIC COURIER SERVICE HERE IN NIGERIA. SO THIS IS
WHY WE NEED A FOREIGN PARTNER AND YOUR HELP.

SINCE YOU WILL BE THE ONE COLLECTING THE PACKAGE IN
THE COUNTRY THAT IT WILL SENT TO, THE SUM WILL BE
SHARED IN THREE WAYS. 20% WILL BE USED TO INVEST IN
YOUR COUNTRY OR COMPANY AND WHILE 20% WILL BE FOR YOU
AND THE OTHER 60% WILL BE FOR US. IS THIS OKAY? WE
ALSO HOPE YOU CAN BE TRUSTED AND THAT YOU WON’T
DISAPPOINT US? AND ALSO CONFIDENTIALITY IS EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT AND BEFORE I FORGET ONCE THE SUM ARRIVES IN
THE DESIGNATED COUNTRY (WHICH I WILL DISCLOSE TO YOU
LATER) WE WILL REQUIRE YOU TO SEND US AN INVITATION
LETTER TO VISIT YOUR COUNTRY AND COLLECT OUR SHARE.
THIS IS NOT A DEAL OR BUSINESS, IT IS A CRY FOR HELP.
MAY GOD GUIDE YOU. WHEN YOU REPLY PLEASE LEAVE YOUR
CONTACT DETAILS, MY PERSONAL ASSISTANT AND FRIEND
UMAN IDRIS  WILL SPEAK TO YOU. HE WILL RELATE ALL
YOUR MESSAGES TO ME, AND IF YOU WISH TO TALK TO ME
JUST TELL HIM AND HE WILL MAKE ALL THE NECESSARY
ARRANGEMENT.AND FOR YOUR OWN INFORMATION THIS MONEY IS
DRUG FREE AND 100% RISK FREE. TIME IS AGAINST US, SO
YOUR URGENT RESPONSE IS NEEDED.

ABOVE, YOU WILL SEE MY E-MAIL ADDRESS YOU CAN SEND ME

ANYTHING YOU ARE CONFUSED ABOUT I WILL EXPLAIN ON
