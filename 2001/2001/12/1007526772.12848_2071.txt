LazyTraders,

You could have made 128% profit on your money this morning using the Lazy DayTrader System.

The Chatroom got into NEXL at 8.14 this morning at $1.62 and it 
went up to $3.70 by 8.55 AM EST.

Members rode it all the way to the top.

Not a bad profit, 128% in 41 minutes.

Learn how to do this yourself at:

http://www.lazytrader.com

and then join Michael's Chatroom for a small monthly fee.

You'll get buzzed when there is a buy.



Have a nice day.

*970% profit is the maximum you could have made in the last 10 weeks if you 
would have bought Michael's Stockpicks when he called them and you would have 
sold at the high for the day. To be able to sell at the high for the day 
consistently is not realistic.
The risk factor is high in stock trading and  only "Risk Capital" or
"Risk 
Funds" should be used in such trading. A person who does not have extra
Risk 
Capital, or Risk Funds, that they can afford to lose, should not trade in the 
market. No "SAFE" trading system has ever been devised, and no one
including us 
can guarantee profits or freedom from loss. We are not brokers or stock 
advisors.
