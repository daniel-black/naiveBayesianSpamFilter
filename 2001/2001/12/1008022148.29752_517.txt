 ROSACEA/ACNE SUFFERERS
 New Herbal Bar Soap from China Helps to
 RID THE SKIN OF ROSACEA, ACNE AND RED BLOTCHES


   It is called MYSTIQUE OF THE ORIENT HERBAL BAR SOAP, and it
is an all-natural soap for severe complexion problems. The secret
is a proven formula developed at Quing Dao Medical University in
China. It is a result of more than a decade of laboratory research
and field testing on over four thousand sufferers of rosacea and
related symptoms.


   MYSTIQUE OF THE ORIENT combines an herbal formula into a fine
soap for easy application. Each bar lasts from 4 to 6 weeks and
delivers dramatic results in short order, often in as little as
two weeks.


   Why is MYSTIQUE OF THE ORIENT so effective when nothing else 
seems to work? The answer is simple. It kills the parasite Demodex
Human, the main cause of most severe skin disorders. At the same
time it is 100% safe, with zero side effects.


   MYSTIQUE OF THE ORIENT is so special, so unique that it was
given the International Award at the 14th Annual Salon Show in
Geneva, Switzerland.

   30-DAY, NO RISK, MONEY BACK GUARANTEE If, after using the
