Dear Advertiser!

We're so sorry, but we don't open our bussiness opportunity in that European country what 
you're looking for, but in China. We open this year on 12th of November our main office in 
Shanghai. 

We're 21 years old Los Angeles based company and we already operate in 51 coutries 
around the world. 

If you need more information about our Chinese Grand Opening (or any information about 
other exciting country) please send e-mail to the next address: 
shanghai.01-12-11@gentlemail.com

Sincerely yours

Steve Power
