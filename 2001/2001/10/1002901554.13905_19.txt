OTCBB Stock Alert's Last Two Picks:

EMRG from $ .60 to $2.50 in 10 days for a GAIN OF OVER 400%!!!
DICE from $ .49 to $1.62 in 7 days for a GAIN OF OVER 300%!!!

HERE IS OUR NEXT EXPLOSIVE STOCK PICK:
Royal Finance, Inc. (OTCBB: ROYA)
BUY AT $1.75
SELL TARGET $5.25 = DIAMOND PLAY !!!!

MAJOR CONTRACT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND HUGE NEWSLETTER COVERAGE
NEXT WEEK FOR ROYA !!!

Revenues for ROYA, a fully-reporting, multi-faceted financial
services firm, have skyrocketed 500% higher this year due to 9
Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, placing rates at their
lowest levels in almost 4 decades.

ROYA is experiencing record breaking loan volume, real estate
sales, and mortgage refinancing as the rush is on with rates
having dropped to bargain basement levels.

We are expecting significant news next week regarding increasing
revenue and significant aquisitions, enhancing the bottom line for
rapid revenue growth.  The stock has already bounced sharply from
its 52-week low and will continue moving up immediately. We think
the stock could easily climb above $6 in less than a month.

WE ARE PROJECTING RECORD VOLUME AND PRICE APPRECIATION AS ROYA MAY
VERY WELL BE ONE OF THE MOST UNDERVALUED STOCKS ON THE OTCBB!!!
