SUBJECT: So, You Want To Be A Songwriter?
Content-Length: 1175

Hello,

I am writing to ask permission to send you information about a great new report booklet I have written about SONGWRITING.  The music business is wide open now, and there has never been a better time to get your music heard.

I have written for many top recording artists, including Randy Travis.

I have been a SONGWRITER for many years, and I realize what it is like to have songs, but not know what to do with them.

The information about the Booklet is absolutely FREE!

If you have any interest in being a SONGWRITER, or know someone who has, you will be glad you responded to this offer.

The information in,  "So, You Want To Be A Songwriter?" is worth hundreds of times the small cost of the booklet.  If you are serious about being a songwriter, this booklet will help a great deal...

E-mail me at:

musica@prontomail.com
Subject line:  Please send songwriting info.

This is a ONE TIME mailing.  You do not have to be removed if you do not reply.

Thank you...

John
