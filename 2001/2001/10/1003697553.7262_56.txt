NEW MICROCHIP CAN TRACK CASH!
A tiny new chip called "MEW", from Hitachi can be 
woven into paper money, and used for identification  
and surveillance tracking. The chip measures just 
0.4 millimeters on a side, and stores security codes.
Airport police, called CASH COPS, already in 
force, look forward to using the new technology.

TURN IN "OLD CASH" FOR "NEW CASH?"
Several governments have already been testing this 
technology and will probably be printing new money 
very soon. Most likely people will have to change 
the old currency for new currency. After that the 
old money will probably be illegal to even possess.
Governments will say it is a "State of Emergency" 
for controlling terrorists, and it will probably 
happen literally overnight.
