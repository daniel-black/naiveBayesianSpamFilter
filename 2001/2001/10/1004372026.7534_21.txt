Chitosan is a compound with unique fat absorbing 

properties. It is derived from chitin, which is found in the 

exoskeletons of shellfish, chemically similar to plant

 fibers, chitosan cannot be digested by the human body. 

Once activated in the stomach, chitosan binds to 

some fatty acids and carries them through the digestive 

system without being absorbed, this helps reduce the 

amount of fat calories digested by the body. Chitosan 

works with your body naturally and can be effective 

in helping to eliminate excess fat from your diet.

Calcium pyruvate is a combination of pyruvic acid and 
calcium, when pyruvate is combined with sodium, 
potassium, magnesium or calcium it forms a stable 
compound known as a pyruvate salt. It is believed that 
pyruvate helps improve muscular performance and 
endurance by enhancing glucose extraction.

Glutamine promotes the assimilation of nutrients, 
regulates protein synthesis, stimulates growth-hormone 
production, and enhances the immune system. Growth 
hormone plays a major role in muscle growth by 
helping synthesize additional proteins in the muscle 
fibers. It also increases the use of fats as an energy 
source.
