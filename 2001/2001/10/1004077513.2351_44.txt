<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The Company</font></h3>
<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'><font size="2">ETPI</font></span></b><font size="2"> 
  is a 23-year old company that has been public for six years.  It is strategically 
  positioned as the provider of a comprehensive array of entertainment products 
  and services to both military and civilian markets.  <b>ETPI</b> is an exclusive 
  supplier of entertainment services on U.S. military bases worldwide and has 
  been awarded an Armed Forces Non-Appropriated Funds (AFNAF) contract that allows 
  them to obtain contracts from the Department of Defense without entering into 
  competitive bidding.</font></font></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
  growth potential for <span class=SpellE>Nitelife</span> is enormous.  <span class=SpellE>Nitelife</span>, 
  <span class=SpellE><b>ETPI’s</b></span><b> </b>bread &amp; butter, has no competitors 
  except for the military themselves.  There are approximately 1200 bases worldwide 
  and presently they service only 68 but that number is steadily growing.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
  stock is essentially near its all-time low when it should be near it’s all-time 
  high.  Looking at the new company infrastructure and how the company is recommitted 
  to focusing on core operations, you see the immediate turn from non-profitability 
  and non-cash flow to positive cash flow and positive earnings per share.</font></p>

  a fundamental standpoint, the stock is currently the most attractive an investment 
  that its been in the six years they’ve been public.  </b>The return to profitability, 
  and the budget release, should provide the explosion to propel the stock to 
  many times its current level.  <b>Don’t miss this outstanding opportunity!</b></font></p>
