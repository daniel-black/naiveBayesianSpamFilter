Demand for Energy is at its highest level putting tremendous pressure on Scientific &amp; Technical Instrumentation companies like CBYI. There is rapid expansion in the energy industry with the need for more power plants and cheaper fuel. CBYI is a major benefactor of the growing need because it supplies specialized "Smell Technology" analyzers for industrial applications in Natural Gas production and transmission. The current industry revenues exceeds $900,000,000 and should reach a triple digit growth rate for the next five or more years. Estimates today indicate that there could be as much as $25 billion in revenues from "smell technology" by the end of 2003.<P><B>RECOMMENDATIONS!</B> <BR>Our last recommendation NXLC rallied, and is up over 117% from the price we recommended in our August newsletter!
