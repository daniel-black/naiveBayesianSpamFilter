Some Comments From Our Users: 
 
"I recently purchased the online version 
of this software from you because I wanted to 
know if my husband was still cheating on me. 
Sure enough, he was. I got the proof I needed 
less than 24 hours after I had made the purchase."
 

"I wanted to let you know that I have 
had your product for a year now. It 
is the best money I have ever spent.
It's easy to install, HIDE, and use. "
 

"I am not really computer literate 
when it comes to using and installing
programs but this one is easy. You can 
monitor anyone who uses the computer."
 

"I highly recommend this product especially 
if you have children on the web." 
 

"Great Product. Easy to use. Easy to 
change options. A breeze to install."


"Helps me keep my employees honest and on 
task." 
 

"If we could have only one program on my 
computer, yours would be it. We love it!" 
 

"This is a definite must for the office PC... 
increases productivity." 
 

"The product is pretty slick. Does what it promises." 
 

"The problem with blocker programs is that they can't 
block it all. Your software proves useful because it 
doesn't have to block the site, it just keeps 
everyone accountable for their own actions. 
Great product." 
 

"One of the BEST investments I EVER made. 
Your product is great. THANKS"
