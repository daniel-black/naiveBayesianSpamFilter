stes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you."
-- Frankie R.

"I'm a man of my 40's and I really know my stuff.  I don't drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path. I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple Kiff. It really amazes me how this stuff taste
s exactly like the lebanese red and blond hash I used to smoke in the 70's and it has a much more pleasurable effect.  I am very satisfied with this product.  I like it a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIS
T at it.  Who would have thought?!  Folks,  this is the real stuff!  Look no further!!"
