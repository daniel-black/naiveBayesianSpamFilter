Dear bruceg,

In todays market success requires a different approach.

I'm not a gambler or a risk taker, I lost a lot of money in the market and I'm so happy that I didn't let this 
opportunity pass me by.

You already own a computer and have an internet connection. While you are on line you might as well 
make yourself some money, right? Like any successful investment strategy, there is a bit of work involved.  
Not many require the low end clerical skills that this offers.  Properly implemented, this program really 
works and though it takes some persistence, anyone can do it!  We all know how to send email (or lick 
stamps if you choose to!)

You can earn $50,000.00 or more in the next 90 days sending E-Mail. Seem impossible? Read on for 
details, is there a catch; no, there is no catch, just send your e-mails and be on your way to financial 
freedom.

As seen on National TV:
"Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home for an investment of only $25.00 
U.S. dollars.

Thanks To The Computer Age And The Internet !
====================================

Before you say "Bull", please read the following.This is the letter you've been hearing about on the news 
lately. 
Due to the popularity of this letter on the internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an 
entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money.

The show also investigated also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings
proved once and for all that there are " absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program, and if 
people can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 dollars 
out of pocket cost."

This is what one had to say:

"Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before, but each time I passed on it. I 
am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for minimal effort and money required. 
To my astonishment, I received a total of $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."

Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.

... this program has been around for a long time, but I never believed in it. One day, when I received this 
again in the mail, I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa... 3 weeks 
later the 
money started to come in. First month, I only made $240.00, but the next 2 months after that I made a total 
of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months, by re-entering the program, I have made over $768,000.00 
and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple instructions and NOT 
CHANGE ANYTHING.
But like most people, I was skeptical and concerned about the legal aspects. So I checked it out with the US 
Postal Service ( 1-800-725-2161 = 24 hours), and they confirmed that it was indeed legal. I am loving it!

If you would like to make at least $100,000.00 every 4 or 5 months, please read the following.... then read it 
again and again and follow the simple instructions. !
Due to the recent increase in popularity and respect this program has attained, it is currently working better 
than ever.

Follow the simple instructions below and your financial dreams will come true, Guaranteed ! The sooner 
you do it, the faster you start making money.

Instructions:
******** Order all 5 reports shown on the list below.
******** For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the name and the number of the report you are ordering and 
your E-Mail address to the person whose name appears on that list next to the report. Make sure your 
return address is on the envelope in case of any mail problems.
******** When you place your order, make sure you order all 5 reports. You will need all 5 reports so that 
you can 
save them on your computer and resell them. Your total cast 5x5=$25.00.
******** Within a few days you will receive via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these five different 
individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the thousands of 
people who will order them from you. Also, make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in 
case something happens to your computer.
******************** Important *******************
Do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any 
way, other than what is instructed below in steps 1 - 6 or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. 
Once you understand how this

Remember, this method has been tested and if you alter it, will not work!!! People have tried putting the

the person 
on report # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.

2.... Move the name and address in report # 4 down to report # 5.

3.... Move the name and address in report # 3 to report # 4.

4.... Move the name and address in report # 2 to report #3.

5.... Move the name and address in report # 1 to report # 2

6.... Insert your name and address in the report # 1 position.

Please make sure you copy every name and address correctly.

***** Take this entire letter with the modified names and addresses and save it on your computer. Do not 
make any other changes. Save this on a disk as well in case you lose any data.

***** To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the five reports you purchase will provide 
you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mail legally, where to find 
thousands of free classified ads and much more. 

There are 2 primary methods to get this venture going :

Method #1: By sending Bulk E-Mail Legally
====================================
Let's say you decide to start out small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume that you and those 
involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each.Let's also assume that the mailings only receive a 0.2% 
response ( the response could be much greater, but let's just say it's only 0.2%. Also, many people will 
send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails, instead of only 5,000 each.) 

Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails, with a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders 
for report # 1.

Those 10 responded by sending out 5,000 e-mails each, for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000, only 
0.2% responded with orders. That's = 100 people responded to report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.
The 0.2% response is 1,000 for report # 3.

Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response 
to that is 10,000 orders for report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50 million e-mails. The 0.2% response to 
that is 100,000 reports for report # 5.

There are over 170 million people on the internet and about 30,000 new customers sign up everyday.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00, (HALF MILLION)

YOUR TOTAL INCOME IN THIS EXAMPLE IS:
1........ $50 +
2........ $500 +
3......... $5,000 +
4 ...... $50,000.+
5....... $500,000 ........................... GRAND TOTAL = $555,550.00

Numbers don't lie! Get a pencil and paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how 
you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money.

Remember Friend, this is assuming that only ten people ordering out of 5000 you mailed to. Dare to think for 
a moment what would happen if everyone, or half or even a fourth of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails 
each or more?
there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do 
that and much more.

Method # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET:
============================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. 
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start 
with Method #1 and then add Method #2 as you go along. 

For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered.
Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail that they send out will 
be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report. 
_________________________________
AVAILABLE REPORTS ________________ ORDER EACH REPORT BY IT'S NAME AND NUMBER ONLY
NOTES:Always send $5 cash (US currency), for each report.Checks not accepted. Make sure the cash is 
concealed by wrapping it at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, write the name and 
number of the report you are ordering, your e-mail address and your name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ Your Success Guidelines $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

*** If you do not receive at least 15 orders for report # 1 within two weeks, continue sending e - mails until 
you do. Your target should be to receive at least 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 - 3 weeks of your mailing 
to be on the safe side.Because some people will do nothing after they sent you $ 5 for report # , ( due to a 
lack of enthusiasm or lack of desire to become a millionaire by the end of the year 2000 ), We suggest you 
continue sending e-mails until you have reached the basic goal.

**** After you have received 15 - 20 orders for report # 1, then 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 
at least 100 orders for report # 2. If you did not, continue sending e-mails until you do.

****Once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is 
already working for you and the cash will continue to roll in.

This is important to remember:
Every time your name is moved down on the list, your name is placed in front of a different report.You can 
keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO 
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS 
OVER AGAIN. There is no limit to the income you can generate with this business.
===============================================================================

The following is a note from the originator of this program:

" You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life with no 
risk and just a little bit of effort. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you 
ever imagined.

Follow the program exactly as instructed. Do not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is 
now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in report 
# 1 and moved others to # 2 ...............# 5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may 
send out a 
100,000 e-mails and your name will be on everyone of them. Remember though, the more you send out the 
more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials 
and opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!

******************************** MORE TESTIMONIALS ****************************

" My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major US Corporation 
and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving " junk mail 
". I made
fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I "knew" it 
wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and a few days later she jumped in with both 
feet. I made merciless fun of her and was ready to lay the old " I told you so " on her when the thing didn't 
work. Well, the laugh was on me ! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days 
she had received total $147,200.00 ............... all cash. I was shocked I have joined Jody in her hobby.

" Not being the gambling type it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But 
conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that was just no was that I wouldn't 
get enough orders to at least get my money back."
I was surprised when I found my medium sized post office box crammed with orders.I made $319,210.00 
in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. 
There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big.
========================================================================

" I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of 
course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by 
someone else .................. 11 months passed, then it luckily came again .............. I did not delete this one.I 
made more than $490,000.00 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks ".
