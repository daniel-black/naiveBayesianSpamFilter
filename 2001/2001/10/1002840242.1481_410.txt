I hope you don't mind me contacting you out of the blue like this, but I thought you 
might find the 
following of interest.

I recently received a series of emails about an innovative new program which costs 
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to enter and yet can generate an income of up to $20,000 in 
just a few 
short weeks.

As you probably would have done, I dismissed these emails at first as just trash, but 
seeing as this 
required ZERO INVESTMENT and just an hour of my time, I decided to give it a try (to 
satisfy my 
curiosity if nothing else). Amazingly, it actually worked. I can only claim to have made 
about 
$3,000 so far, but that's $3,000 more than I thought I would get!

If you would like a copy of the email, which contains the full instructions on how to 
proceed, email 
me at jbaker757@excite.com and I'll be happy to oblige.

Regards,
John.

P.S. This is entirely legal and 'above board', so you have no worries on that score.
