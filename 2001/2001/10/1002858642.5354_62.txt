Hi my name is Steve and I just wanted to inform you of a new source of traffic for your site.

Pointcom.com is a pay-per-click search engine that operates in a similar
way to Goto.com. We have established ourselves as a safe and reliable
source of quality traffic over the past 3 years and look forward to
strengthening our position in the future.  We receive approximately 4.5 million unique visitors to our site every month.

We can set up an account for you (for permanent or trial use) consisting
of your tracking url, title and description designed by our online
professionals guaranteed to pre-qualify your traffic and thus increase
conversions. Our minimum bid on any key term is only 1 cent, and with our
category feature, you can get access to over 7,000 key terms under the one
easy bid of 1 cent a click.



Once the account is up and running you have full access to reports on
statistics, the ability to modify your account on the run with all updates
taking place in real time. 

If you have any questions or queries, please write back to me and I'll be
more than happy to answer them. Alternatively, why not have a look at our
site yourself at http://www.pointcom.com.
