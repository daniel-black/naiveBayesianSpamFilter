FAQ

Are you  a  legitimate company and  do you provide a  guarantee?
Answer: Our product DOES work, we are not crooks and you can be sure that if it didnt work our previous customers would have asked for a charge back and got it. If more then 5% of our customers had requested a charge back then our Credit Card merchant account would have  been  shut down a long time ago and all the money returned to all purchasers.

Can you provide a trial of the program?
Answer: Unfortunately we cannot give out evaluation copies as once you have the information sent to you thats all you need to start,  our product DOES work.

Are the instructions easy  to follow?  
Answer: Yes, instructions are part of the package and are very easy to  follow. If you follow them to the letter we  guarantee you wont have a problem.

Do I lose picture quality  when burning?
Answer: If you follow the directions as stated in this software, your copy will be just like the original. The DVD is being compressed,  if you like you can put it on 2 CDR's for the highest quality picture and sound.

What is the sound quality like?
Answer: The sound quality should be the same as what the DVD is. If the DVD supports Dolby then your VCD will to.


Note: Backing up of DVD's is only allowed if you own
the original DVD. It is against the law to reproduce
copyrighted material for the purpose of selling it
to third parties. US Laws only allow for you to
make a backup copy of any software or media for
