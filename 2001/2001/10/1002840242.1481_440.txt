PROFESSIONAL, EFFECTIVE DEBT COLLECTION SERVICES AVAILABLE

For the last seventeen years, National Credit Systems, Inc. has been providing top flight debt collection services to over 15,000 businesses, institutions, and healthcare providers.

We charge only a low-flat fee (less than $20) per account, and all proceeds are forwarded to you directly -- not to your collections agency.

If you wish, we will report unpaid accounts to Experian (formerly TRW), TRANSUNION, and Equifax. There is no charge for this important service.
