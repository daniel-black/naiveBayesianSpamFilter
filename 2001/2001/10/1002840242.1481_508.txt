If you follow world events, you probably know that the prices of commodities
and stocks reflect international politics and tensions!  That's why the
stock market lost over 10% in just a few days after the recent terrorist
attacks.

As the U.S. prepares its response, tensions could escalate even further in
the Middle East.  This could have a DRAMATIC IMPACT on the supply of oil and
gas therefore increasing worldwide prices. If this happens, oil and gas
companies and THEIR SHAREHOLDERS could be poised to MAKE MONEY from any
price increases.

That's why many people consider oil and gas stocks not just a great
speculative investment, but also an insurance against future market
developments.

In addition, many oil and gas stocks are currently selling at a VERY LOW P/E
MULTIPLES! So, even if the price of oil doesn't skyrocket, those companies
may still be great investments.
