with serious, motivated people who are ready to make changes in<br>
their life NOW! And because of the time we spend with each of<br>
you as we help you get your business off the ground, we have<br>
limited number of openings available. Here is what you need to<br>
do...<br>
<br>
This business fell into my lap in September of 1997. I got<br>
started as a customer and woke up when my wife made an extra<br>
$500 in the first week. At the time I was an Active Duty Marine<br>
living paycheck to paycheck making less that $19,000 a year. I<br>
was attending college at a local University and had two<br>
children. $500 at that time would have been a dream come true. I<br>
got started and in our first month I earned $2700 profit, and in<br>
the first four months my wife and I made $19,000 profit.  I had<br>
made more in 4 months than I made in an entire year as an active<br>
duty Marine just part time working 10 - 12 hrs a week.<br>
<br>
The average person can start earning any where from $25.00 -<br>
$75.00 an hour from their home or office computers without<br>
dedicating allot of time and effort. Most of us have been<br>
thinking it's about time we took advantage of this Internet<br>
Craze.  Through out the Holidays and especially the last year,<br>
every thing that we have seen on Television and heard on the<br>
Radio has either started or ended with www. -----------. Com and<br>
the reason why is because the Internet has truly simplified<br>
shopping, convenience which frees up more time for all of us to<br>
turn that time into quality time. Security and convenience has<br>
been technologically advanced to give us all the piece of mind.<br>
E-Commerce is so rampant right now that most of the states in<br>
the U.S. are buying their groceries over the Internet<br>
<br>
This is your opportunity to take advantage of the E-commerce<br>
that is literally changing the way the world does business.<br>
Internet Marketing Group will show you how you can work at home<br>
using your very own e-commerce storefront.  Our opportunity is<br>
the only business of its kind right now.  It's growing by leaps<br>
and bounds and you can be a part of it while you work at home.<br>
The Work at Home Network with our company was reviewed and<br>
published Wall Street Journal, Business Week, Home PC, Forbes,<br>
Success, and Money, just to name a few.  You can work at home<br>
and use the Internet to run your business.  You can market our<br>
high demand consumable products that are geared and driven by<br>
the needs of over eighty- percent of the world's population.<br>
Our products sell them selves, so there is no selling or need<br>
for out right sales techniques.  Also because they are high<br>
demand consumable products, return business, on going business,<br>
and referral business is generated.  By working at home, you<br>
reduce overhead, set your own schedule, be your own boss, and<br>
achieve your own goals.  Be an entrepreneur, WORK AT HOME!<br>
<br>
The Market Opportunity is colossal. Over 1/2 of American homes<br>
have a computer, and E-Commerce sales are increasing month on<br>
month.  America is looking for a better way to buy our products<br>
and now with this opportunity you can.  The Work at Home Network<br>
a brand of e-commerce that is enabled and energized.  The five<br>
top industries in the world are Medical - Health  - Nutrition,<br>
Computer, Personal Care, Communication and the Burial Businesses<br>
due to the Baby Boomers.  The Work at Home Network put them all<br>
into a package except for the Burial Business.  Our industries<br>
are guaranteed to be the fastest growing industries for the next<br>
18 years and each year sales have doubled almost tripled.<br>
<br>
If your country is listed here, you are eligible to start doing<br>
business immediately.  (Argentina, India, Cyprus, Greece,<br>
Poland, Australia, Hong Kong, Russia, Austria, Indonesia,<br>
Portugal, Belgium, Israel, South Africa, Botswana, Italy, Spain,<br>
Brazil, Jamaica, Swaziland, Canada, Japan, Sweden, Chile, Korea,<br>
Switzerland, Czech Republic, Lesotho, Taiwan, Denmark, Mexico,<br>
Thailand, Dominican Republic, Namibia, Turkey, Finland, The<br>
Netherlands, United Kingdom, France, New Zealand, United States,<br>
Germany, Norway, Venezuela, Philippines, Ireland, Panama,<br>
Morocco, and China)<br>
<br>
However, if your country is not listed here, it does not mean we<br>
won't be there very soon. Because our company is expanding into<br>
several countries a year, yours could be the next one to become<br>
available. This is an optimal position to be in, one that you<br>
will definitely want to take advantage of. Due to the fact that<br>
countries can "open" only once in our industry, if you are one<br>
of the first to receive this valuable information and one of the<br>
first to start softening your market, you will belong to an<br>
exclusive group of wealthy leaders. Our experience in 50<br>
countries confirms this fact.<br>
<br>
One of the strongest aspects of our business is the on going<br>
training that is offered. We have International Training's on an<br>
ongoing basis in most major cities. Weekly conference calls are<br>
also available, as well as satellite television training<br>
programs, monthly magazine's and quarterly journals. Our company<br>
does over 1.5 billion US Dollars in business annually and you<br>
too can be a part of this growth.  Maybe some of you have tried<br>
other businesses and failed. We welcome you with open arms. Here<br>
you will find success because we give you the blueprint to<br>
follow and support you need to develop your own profitable<br>
home-based business. All we ask of you is to be coachable and be<br>
willing to learn. We have no need for tire-kickers or window<br>
shoppers.  Please do not request our "decision package" if you<br>
are not serious about changing the course in your life right<br>
now. By ordering your "decision package", you will receive all<br>
you need to get yourself moving towards financial independence.<br>
<br>
So, if you are tired of worrying about money and tired of<br>
choosing what you can live without, come join the thousands of<br>
us working from home, setting our own schedules, making a<br>
fortune and living out our dreams. We invite you to explore how<br>
the "Work From Home" Internet Program capitalizes on today's<br>
advancements in technology to help you build a successful<br>
home-based business.<br>
<br>
Have you noticed the surge of people looking to start home-based<br>
businesses?  Did you know that 32 million households now have<br>
home-based businesses and that number grows every day? Have you<br>
asked yourself, "Why?" Why are so many people, including<br>
yourself, interested in working from home? Our parents never<br>
searched for a business to operate from home nor did their<br>
friends. So, why now and why is it suddenly so popular?<br>
<br>
Americans are "cocooning". We want to spend less time on the<br>
busy freeways commuting, and in over-crowded shopping malls and<br>
replace that with spending more time at home with our families<br>
where it is warm and safe. Apparently, we trust society less and<br>
want to protect ourselves and our families from the "cruel"<br>
outside world. This is the wave of the future and we are<br>
beginning to realize with the advancement in technology, we do<br>
not need to be in an office environment in order to access the<br>
not need to be in an office environment in order to access the<br>
marketplace and make money.  In today's world, the quickest way<br>
to build a home-based business is to take advantage of the<br>
Internet craze that has hit the United States and is quickly<br>
spreading around the world. Like how the Gutenberg Press<br>
radically changed the communication world in 16th Century<br>
Europe, the Internet is revolutionizing how we communicate,<br>
distribute information and the manner in how and where we spend<br>
our money. It has been said that those who pursue electronic<br>
commerce (business over the Internet) have the opportunity to<br>
build an explosive business.  While a conventional business can<br>
cost thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars to set up and<br>
run successfully, an Internet business costs dramatically less<br>
and has the potential to attract international business for just<br>
a fraction of what the traditional company would spend. On<br>
average, 30% of all U.S. web traffic is already international<br>
and 5% to 20% of all web sales originate from outside the United<br>
States. Everyday, these percentages are radically increasing.<br>
Consumers worldwide are spending 6.6 billion U.S. dollars a year<br>
in transactions over the Internet.  The awareness level and need<br>
for users, buyers, advertisers and merchants to get onto the<br>
Web, and to set-up shop, has dramatically changed even from one<br>
year ago.  This medium of doing business is skyrocketing, and we<br>
are reaping the benefits, daily.  If you combine the Internet<br>
craze with people's desire to work from home and set their own<br>
schedule, you have a powerful team, and here is why. Many people<br>
have heard of SOHO, and no, we don't mean that hip section of<br>
New York City, rather the S.O.H.O. which refers to "Small<br>
Office/Home Office." One of today's biggest explosions in the<br>
economy. The home-based business has been born out of necessity.<br>
In an era where large corporations can only think of downsizing,<br>
what are your options? There is no security in Corporate America<br>
any more!  Not only are tens of thousands of workers and<br>
managers being downsized out of their companies, but also<br>
thousands of men and women are tired of the corporate "rat race"<br>
and want to retreat to a home-based business.<br>
<br>
If you decide to "stick it out" in Corporate America or the<br>
Corporate World, your choices could boil down to finding a<br>
lucrative niche in the small business world, standing in line at<br>
the unemployment office, or accepting a cut in pay and benefits.<br>
We were all raised to give 9 hours work for 8 hours pay, and we<br>
are not backing away from that. Today's large companies have no<br>
loyalty to the employees. Their only loyalty is to the bottom<br>
line. And the bottom line is exactly where most of us are when<br>
it's time to cut back. Your life is suddenly turned upside down<br>
because you have no control over your future. Someone who has no<br>
idea of the quality of your work makes these decisions behind<br>
closed doors or the extra time you gave the company without<br>
requesting overtime. They don't know about your family's life:<br>
they don't understand that you just put braces on your child's<br>
teeth and now have to pay for them. These "decision makers" job<br>
is to be impersonal and unbiased in all areas except for the<br>
company's "best interests." In other words: TO THEM, YOU REALLY<br>
DON'T MATTER.<br>
<br>
The Great American Dream is gone. Official U.S. government<br>
reports indicate that more than 3.5 million jobs have been<br>
eliminated in the past 10 years - including over 2000 jobs per<br>
day last year alone - and an estimated 55% of all jobs created<br>
in the next 10 years will be near minimum wage in stores,<br>
restaurants, and bars. 90% of all the people in North America<br>
earn less than $40,000 a year and today's two-income family are<br>
not living as well as their parents did.  So what is the<br>
alternative to the to the Great American Job? Richard Poe,<br>
former senior editor for "Success Magazine," describes in his<br>
recent book that a shift in thinking has resulted in over 14<br>
million people working from home full-time, and another 13<br>
million part-time. This number is increasing by almost 600,000<br>
per year.  And the average work from home income is $50,250 per<br>
year, about twice the average income of wage earners working for<br>
someone else. By the end of the decade over 44% of us will be<br>
working from home.<br>
<br>
Home based business wage earner's success rate is over 85%<br>
compared with small businesses like retail shops and<br>
restaurants, at about 95% failure rate after 5 years. Couple<br>
that with the flexibility we have to change our schedules and<br>
set our hours and then those of us who are parents are now<br>
available when our children need us, plus we no longer have the<br>
need for the "foster homes" we call day cares, where the<br>
care-givers get to see all the "firsts" your child performs.<br>
There's no wonder the number of people looking to work from home<br>
has skyrocketed.  This "New Era" of financial growth is largely<br>
due to the latest technologies that are now available to those<br>
who desire to work from home. Imagine what it would be like to<br>
run an international operation if you so choose, right from the<br>
comfort of your own home. Well, this is exactly what we offer!<br>
We offer a "freedom" that is available through a constant flow<br>
We offer a "freedom" that is available through a constant flow<br>
of income that does not depend on the whims of a boss, bonuses<br>
or the economy.<br>
<br>
Take a look at some of these statistics:  At age 50, 75% of the<br>
population has less than $5,000 in the bank for retirement.  At<br>
age 65, 45% of Americans depend on relatives, 30% depend on<br>
charities, 23% are still working (most can't afford to quit and<br>
work until they are no longer physically capable) and Only 2%<br>
are self-sustaining.  At the present time, it is impossible to<br>
support a family of two working full time at minimum wage!  For<br>
the first time in history, the current generation is averaging a<br>
lower standard of living then their parents!  Automation is<br>
taking layoffs to record highs!<br>
<br>
The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that Out of 100 people that<br>
start working at the age of 25, by the age of 65... - 1 is<br>
wealthy - 4 have enough money to retire - 63 depend on social<br>
security or charity - 29 are deceased 95% of people, age 65 and<br>
over cannot afford to retire and work until they die!!  What<br>
Happened to Safety &amp; Security?  Why we no longer put our trust =
&amp;<br>
faith in "Big Business".  In J. Paul Getty's book "How To Get<br>
Rich", his first rule for success is, "You must be in business<br>
for yourself. You will never get rich working for someone else."<br>
This partly explains why someone starts a new home-based<br>
business in the United States every 10 seconds. In the past 14<br>
years alone, the numbers of home-based businesses have grown<br>
from 6 million to 32 million with no slow - down in sight. In<br>
fact, an estimated 8,493 new home businesses open every day.<br>
The United States is now driven by an information and service<br>
economy. Over the past decade, Fortune 500 companies have laid<br>
off 4.4 million workers while smaller companies steadily<br>
continue to reduce their work forces.  As companies continue to<br>
downsize and re-organize, many professionals will seek out and<br>
search for new ways to take control of their careers. Many of<br>
these individuals have forsworn traditional "nine to five"<br>
office jobs and are making their homes pay off in more ways than<br>
one.<br>
<br>
For the entrepreneur, home-based businesses have become the<br>
bridge between work- crazed big cities and easy- paced<br>
family-oriented small towns. Link Resources Corp. reports that<br>
market research shows more than 29 million people run either<br>
full-time or part-time businesses from their homes. People used<br>
to believe that their livelihood depended on living in big<br>
cities near big corporations. That is no longer true, thanks to<br>
personal computers, increased phone services, fax machines, and<br>
the Internet, it is no longer necessary to live in close<br>
proximity to "Big Business". You can now operate that "Big<br>
Business" right from your home office.  Within the last five to<br>
seven years, technology has been brought to an affordable level<br>
so that almost everyone has an equal playing field in the<br>
work-from-home industry.  Check out these Statistics:  11% of<br>
the US market is now on the Internet 1,092,000 new people get<br>
Internet access each week, while approximately 38% of the US<br>
adult population, or 68 million US citizens' currently use the<br>
adult population, or 68 million US citizens' currently use the<br>
Internet, according to the fall 1999 Cyber Status reports from<br>
Mediamark Research Inc. This is an increase of 49% from the<br>
prior quarter, and this study only counts people who have used<br>
the Internet in the last 30 days.<br>
<br>
Ziff-Davis's Technology User Profile reported that there are 60<br>
million PC's connected to the Internet in the US, but home PC's<br>
still represent the lion's share of the market, with 68 million<br>
consumers hooked up to the Internet.  They predict that up to<br>
$54 billion US dollars will change hands from business<br>
transactions online by year 2001.<br>
<br>
Most people are ready to do some sort of business online, they<br>
just don't know where to start. This is why we are so<br>
successful. We link-up our marketing techniques with something<br>
people need, and most of all, something people want. If you add<br>
strong work ethics, a powerful support system, along with<br>
personal business coaching, you can't help but be successful. We<br>
provide not only the vehicle that puts you on the road to<br>
success, but we also provide the road map.  All you have to do<br>
is be teachable, have the desire for a better life and be<br>
willing to change what you're doing now.  94% of home-based<br>
business owners are happier running their own business versus<br>
working for someone else.  92% recommend working from home to<br>
others.  94% plan to still be running their own business in five<br>
years.  20% of home entrepreneurs reported that their businesses<br>
grossed between $100,000 and $500,000 last year.  23% paid<br>
themselves annual salaries of $65,000 to $350,000.  41% work at<br>
home with other family members.  71% think their businesses are<br>
doing as well or better than they expected.  79% expect their<br>
home-based business revenues to grow this year.  Your search for<br>
the ideal work environment and for the ideal vehicle to wealth<br>
is over. You will be able to work more flexible hours while<br>
increasing your productivity, not to mention drastically cutting<br>
your commute time, and increasing your most precious<br>
commodity-quality of life.<br>
<br>
We have developed one of the most exciting, technologically<br>
advanced home-based businesses that will take you through the<br>
new millennium.  We don't expect you to come to us with<br>
tremendous business knowledge or a successful track record. We<br>
have already figured out how to make this work; all you need to<br>

If you are unsure and need more information, we have put<br>
together a "How to do business over the Internet" decision<br>
package that will help you determine whether our business is for<br>
you or not.  This step is only for individuals who have the<br>
desire to control their own future and who want to work from<br>
their homes and earn the kind of income that will give you the<br>
life you deserve. This decision package contains approximately<br>
three hours of information about our explosive Internet business<br>
and it also begins your training. You will receive a manual that<br>
explains how, why and what we are doing, a video where you'll<br>
meet us and see exactly how our business works and an audiotape<br>
to further help you with your decision. Your package also<br>
contains the name and telephone number of your personal coach<br>
who will be working with you on a daily basis, helping you make<br>
money in your first week. In other words, you will receive all<br>
of the information you will need to make a decision to determine<br>
if this is for you.<br>
<br>
After you request your "International Decision Package", and go<br>
through all the materials, we will call you and your personal<br>
training program will begin. At that point, we will also be<br>
happy to locate the nearest training to you, which are available<br>
in numerous translations. We have training being conducted in<br>
over 27 different languages worldwide!  This package acts only<br>
as a way for you to review information about our business and<br>
begins your training without risk.  This step eliminates the<br>
people who are not serious and allows us to work with those of<br>
you who are. Please recognize the importance of this step. We<br>
simply do not have the time to spend with people who are merely<br>
curious, which is why we designed this package to provide you<br>
with all of the information you will need to make a decision and<br>
determine if this is for you. If we spent our time answering<br>
e-mail requests for additional information, we'd not only be<br>
duplicating the effort we put into developing the decision<br>
package, but we'd also be taking valuable time away from running<br>
our business and training new people. Once you start working<br>
with us, we're sure you will appreciate our spending time<br>
training you instead of responding to curious e-mails all day<br>
long.<br>
<br>
Since we don't spend countless hours answering the tireless<br>
questions of the curiosity-seekers, you benefit, because it<br>
frees us up in order to dedicate ourselves to your success. When<br>
we spend time with you, we know we are working with someone who,<br>
like us, is committed to a better lifestyle.  What is Your<br>
Future Worth?  Decide for yourself and for your family what it<br>
is you want and by when you want to achieve it.  Only you can<br>
determine how dedicated you are to achieving your dreams.<br>
Hopefully, you won't find yourself relying on your friends and<br>
family for direction and salvation. They cannot provide that for<br>
you - only you can do that. You need to make a decision to<br>
either give this a shot or to continue down the path you're on.<br>
Most likely, if you have read this far, you have already made<br>
the decision to make some healthy changes in your life. When we<br>
were looking at this "Work From Home" Opportunity for the first<br>
time, just like you, we were nervous and thought that maybe this<br>
wouldn't work. Like you, we doubted we could really achieve our<br>
dreams. We went for it any way and now we are making incredible<br>
incomes, working from home, and for most of us- it's a dream<br>
come true. We don't have a boss to answer to or a clock to<br>
punch.<br>
<br>
All you need to do now is take action. Take action by ordering<br>
your "Decision Package" and we'll be there to help you through<br>
your questions and then to work with you to build your own "Work<br>
>From Home" Internet Business. But please don't request more<br>
information unless you are committed to improving your life. If<br>
you are ready to learn and you are serious about achieving a<br>
brighter future and a better life, then we are committed to you.<br>
We are ready to give you the same step-by-step plan we used to<br>
build our fortune. There will be no surprises. We know exactly<br>
what to do and how to coach others be successful within the same<br>
system. Our Program works. It's already happening for hundreds<br>
of people. Why not you? Right now, take the next step, and get<br>
started on your way to a brighter lifestyle.<br>
<br>
STEP 2: To get started or request your decision package only<br>
after you have completed STEP 1 please call our international 24<br>
hour order hotline at 1-206-222-2829.  International callers and<br>
 for United States, Canada, and Mexico callers please also dial<br>
1-206-222-2829.<br>
<br>
We are willing to train you and work with you, as others have<br>
done with us, to help secure your financial future. But,<br>
remember, we only work with those that truly have the desire and<br>
ambitions to work-we don't have time to work with couch<br>
potatoes! Successful people do what unsuccessful people won't.<br>
<br>
So develop a sense of urgency and give your desires value!<br>
Procrastination is the biggest killer of success and you can now<br>
break that cycle! REMEMBER, for things to change, you have to<br>
change and for things to get better, you have to get better. Order<br>
your materials today, and when they arrive, review everything<br>
thoroughly BEFORE calling your personal coach.<br>
<br>
Remember the importance of following directions- we are looking<br>
for people who are teachable and willing to work. We're very<br>
excited about our future and we know you will be, too!! Until we<br>
speak personally, thank you and have a great day!<br>
