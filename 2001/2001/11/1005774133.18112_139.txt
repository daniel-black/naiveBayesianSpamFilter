Stock Alert Newsletter

PPI Capital Group, Inc.
Symbol: PPIM
Exchange: OTCBB
Recent Price: $2.50
52 Week Range: $1.00 - 6.25
Shares Outstanding: 11.9 million
Estimated Float: 1.5 Million

PPI Capital is a financial technology company with a unique twist. They are 
the operator of Direct Placement, Inc., the acknowledged leader providing 
information on PIPE offerings, as well as an investment banker handling those 
securities.  

A PIPE is when a company sells a block of stock to investors privately, often 
at a discount from the market price. In today’s slow economy, many public 
companies are willing to give up a few dollars in order to raise money quickly. 
Because of this, bigger names are flocking to the market, along with major 
mutual funds like Fidelity and Franklin Templeton.  So far this year, there have
been $64 Billion in PIPE financings, compared to $58 Billion in all of 2000, up 
from $12 million as recently as 1998.

On October 8, PPIM announced that they were acquiring a California brokerage 
called PCH Securities. They expect to use PCH as a vehicle to buyout other
stockbrokers while prices are currently depressed. Due to this aggressive strategy, 
we believe that the company is about to make the turnaround into a well-known, 
profitable firm.

Since PPI Capital only went public in June, this is the first time they have been 
featured in a stock market write up. This gives Stock Alert readers a “ground floor” 
opportunity. PPI has a float of just 1.5 million shares, so a relatively small amount 
of buying could move it up substantially. We believe PPIM is attractive at prices up 
to $4, looking for the stock to retest the $6.25 peak reached in June.
