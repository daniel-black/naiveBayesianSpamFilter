<DIV><FONT size=2>His mother was cleaning and putting laundry <BR>away when she 
came across a large brown paper bag that <BR>was suspiciously buried beneath 
some clothes and<BR>a skateboard in the back of her son's closet. <BR>Nothing 
could have prepared her for the shock she got <BR>when she opened the bag and 
found it was full of cash. Five <BR>dollar bills, twenties, fifties and 
hundreds- all neatly<BR>rubber-banded in labeled piles. "My first thought was 
that<BR>he had robbed a bank", says the 41-year-old woman, <BR>"There was over 
$71,000 dollars in that bag- <BR>that's more than my husband earns in a 
year."<BR><BR>The woman immediately called her husband at <BR>the car-dealership 
where he worked to tell him what she'd <BR>discovered. He came home right away 
and they<BR>drove together to the boy's school and picked him up.<BR>Little did 
they suspect that where the money came <BR>from was as surprising as actually 
finding it in the closet.<BR><BR>As it turns out, the boy had been sending out 
via e-mail<BR>on the internet what looked like a type of chain-letter to 
<BR>e-mail addresses that he obtained off of the internet. <BR>Everyday after 
school for the past 2 months, he had been <BR>doing this right on his computer 
in his bedroom.<BR><BR>"I just got the I-mail one day and I figured what 
the<BR>heck, I put my name on it like the instructions <BR>said and I started 
sending it out", says the clever 15-year-old.<BR><BR>The E-mail letter listed 5 
addresses and contained instructions<BR>to send five $5 dollar bills to the 
people on the list, then<BR>delete the bottom address and move the other 4 
addresses<BR>down, and finally to add your name to the top of the list. 
The<BR>letter goes on to state that you would receive several 
thousand<BR>dollars in 5$ dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the 
<BR>letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list. <BR>"I get junk 
E-mail all the time, and I really didn't think <BR>it was gonna work", the boy 
continues.<BR><BR>Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, 
the<BR>Post Office Box that his parents had gotten for his 
video-game<BR>magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines,<BR>but 
envelopes containing $5 dollar bills. "About a week <BR>later I rode (my bike) 
down to the post office and my box had 1<BR>magazine and about 300 envelopes 
stuffed in it. There was a <BR>yellow slip that said I had to go up to the (post 
office) counter- <BR>I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)". He goes 
<BR>on, "I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of <BR>more mail for 
me. I had to ride back home and empty out my <BR>backpack 'cause I couldn't 
carry it all."<BR><BR>Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out 
the<BR>E-mail. "The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting<BR>it and 
stashing it in the closet, I barely had time for my<BR>homework". He had also 
been riding his bike to several of<BR>the area's banks and exchanging the $5 
bills for twenties,<BR>fifties and hundreds. "I didn't want the banks to 
get<BR>suspicious, so I kept riding to different banks with <BR>like five 
thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually <BR>tell the lady at the bank 
counter that my dad had sent me in \(to <BR>exchange the money) and he was 
outside waiting for me. <BR>One time the lady gave me a really strange look and 
told me <BR>that she wouldn't be able to do it for me and my dad would <BR>have 
to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next bank <BR>down the 
street."<BR><BR>Actually, the boy didn't have any reason to be afraid.<BR>The 
reporting news team examined and investigated the<BR>so-called 'chain-letter' 
the boy was sending out and <BR>found that it wasn't a chain-letter at all. In 
fact, it was <BR>completely legal complying with US Postal and Lottery Laws, 
<BR>Title 18, Section 1302 and1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 <BR>in the US 
code, also in the cod of federal regulations, <BR>Volume 16, Sections 255 and 
436, which states a product <BR>or service must be exchanged for money 
received.<BR><BR>Every five dollar bill that he received was exchanged 
for<BR>the valuable reports he sent out via e-mail. This simple<BR>process made 
the letter legal because he was <BR>exchanging a product (sending a valuable 
report via e-mail) <BR>to each for a five dollar fee.<BR><BR></DIV>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! 
<BR><BR>&nbsp; Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the 
letter <BR>&nbsp; you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the 
popularity of <BR>&nbsp; this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news 
program recently devoted <BR>&nbsp; an entire show to the investigation of this 
program described below, to see if it <BR>&nbsp; really can make people money. 
The show also investigated whether or not the <BR>&nbsp; program was legal. 
<BR><BR>&nbsp; Their findings proved once and for all that there are 
''absolutely NO <BR>&nbsp; Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and 
if people can "follow <BR>&nbsp; the simple instruction" they are bound to make 
some mega bucks with only <BR>&nbsp; $25 out of pocket cost''. <BR>&nbsp; DUE TO 
THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY &amp; RESPECT THIS <BR>&nbsp; PROGRAM HAS 
ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY&nbsp;&nbsp; WORKING BETTER&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;THAN EVER. 
<BR><BR>&nbsp; This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable 
opportunity". I <BR>&nbsp; was approached many times before but each time I 
passed on it. I am so glad <BR>&nbsp; I finally joined just to see what one 
could expect in return for the <BR>&nbsp; minimal effort and money required. To 
my astonishment, I received a total $ <BR>&nbsp; 610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with 
money still coming in''. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;<FONT face=Tahoma>&nbsp; </FONT>Another said: "This program has been 
around for a long time but I never <BR>&nbsp; believed in it. But one day when I 
received this again in the mail I <BR>&nbsp; decided to gamble my $25 on it. I 
followed the simple instructions and <BR>&nbsp; walaa ..... 3 weeks later the 
money started to come in. First month I only made <BR>&nbsp; $240.00 but the 
next 2 months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, <BR>&nbsp; in 
the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over 
$710,000.00&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; and I am playing it again. The key to success

would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily <BR>&nbsp; and 
comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and <BR>&nbsp; AGAIN 
!!! <BR><BR>&nbsp; $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 
<BR><BR>&nbsp; FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR 
FINANCIAL&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! 
<BR><BR>&nbsp; INSTRUCTIONS: <BR><BR>&nbsp; =====Order all 5 reports shown on 
the list below ===== <BR><BR>&nbsp; For each report, send US$5 CASH, THE NAME 
&amp; NUMBER OF THE&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL 
ADDRESS to the <BR>&nbsp; person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the 
report. MAKE SURE <BR>&nbsp; YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT 
CORNER <BR>&nbsp; in case of any mail problems. <BR><BR>&nbsp; ===WHEN YOU PLACE 
YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE === <BR>&nbsp; ===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! === 
<BR>&nbsp; You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your 
computer <BR>&nbsp; and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00. 
<BR><BR>&nbsp; Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 
reports <BR>&nbsp; from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your 
computer so they will <BR>&nbsp; be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of 
people who will order them <BR>&nbsp; from you. Also make a floppy of these 
reports and keep it on your desk in case <BR>&nbsp; something happens to your 
computer. <BR><BR>&nbsp; IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who 
are listed next to <BR>&nbsp; each report, or their sequence on the list, in any 
way other than what is <BR>&nbsp; instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or 
you will loose out on the <BR>&nbsp; majority of your profits. Once you 
understand the way this works, you will also<BR>&nbsp; see how&nbsp; it does not 
work if you change it. Remember, this method has been<BR>&nbsp; tested, 
and&nbsp; if you alter it, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put their 
<BR>&nbsp; friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the 
money. <BR>&nbsp; But it does not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to 
be greedy and then<BR>&nbsp; nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything 
other than what is <BR>&nbsp; instructed. <BR>&nbsp; Because if you do, it will 
not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the <BR>&nbsp; reward!!! 
<BR>&nbsp;This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a product for sale and 
getting <BR>&nbsp;paid for it. Treat it as such and you will be VERY profitable 
in a short period of <BR>&nbsp; time. <BR><BR>&nbsp; 1.. After you have ordered 
all 5 reports, take this advertisement and <BR>&nbsp; REMOVE the name &amp; 
address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has <BR>&nbsp; made it through 
the cycle and is no doubt counting his/her fortune. <BR><BR>&nbsp; 2..Move the 
name &amp; address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. <BR><BR>&nbsp; 3.. Move the 
name &amp; address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. <BR><BR>&nbsp; 4.. Move the 
name &amp; address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. <BR><BR>&nbsp; 5.. Move the 
name &amp; address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 <BR><BR>&nbsp; 6.... Insert 
YOUR name &amp; address in the REPORT # 1 Position. <BR><BR>&nbsp; PLEASE MAKE 
SURE you copy every name &amp; address ACCURATELY! </DIV>

<STRONG>METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY</STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV align=left>
<HR style="WIDTH: 397px; HEIGHT: 4px" align=left>
&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it 
goes, and we <BR>&nbsp; will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 
e-mails each. <BR>&nbsp; Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% 
(2/10 of 1%) <BR>&nbsp; response (the response could be much better but lets 
just say it is only 0.2%). <BR>&nbsp; Also many people will send out hundreds of 
thousands e-mails instead of only <BR>&nbsp; 5,000 each). <BR>&nbsp; Continuing 
with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. <BR><BR>&nbsp; With a 0.2% 
response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 <BR>&nbsp; people 
responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. <BR>&nbsp; Out 
of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people 
<BR>&nbsp; responded and ordered Report # 2. <BR><BR>&nbsp; Those 100 people 
mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 <BR>&nbsp; e-mails. The 0.2% 
response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. <BR><BR>&nbsp; Those 1000 people 
send 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 5 million <BR>&nbsp; e-mail sent out. The 
0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. <BR><BR>&nbsp; Those 10,000 
people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 <BR>&nbsp; (50 
million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for <BR>&nbsp; 
Report # 5. <BR><BR>&nbsp; THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 
(half a million dollars).&nbsp;<BR><BR>&nbsp;<FONT face=Tahoma>Your total incom

&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING 
OUT OF 5,000 YOU <BR>MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if 
everyone or half or even one 4th <BR>of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each 
or more? <BR>There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and 
counting, with&nbsp; thousands more <BR>coming on line every day. Believe me, 
many people will do just that, and more! <BR><BR>&nbsp; <STRONG>METHOD # 2: BY 
PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET</STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV align=left>
<HR style="WIDTH: 397px; HEIGHT: 4px" align=left>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there 
are hundreds <BR>&nbsp; of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads 
on the Internet will <BR>&nbsp; easily get a larger response. We strongly 
suggest you start with Method # 1 <BR>&nbsp; and add METHOD #2 as you go along. 
For every $5 you receive, all you must <BR>&nbsp; do is e-mail them the Report 
they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day <BR>&nbsp; service on all 
orders. <BR><BR>&nbsp; This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with 
your name and <BR>&nbsp; address on it, will be prompt because they can not 
advertise until they <BR>&nbsp; receive the report. <BR><BR>&nbsp; 
===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== <BR>&nbsp; The reason for the 
"cash" is not because this is illegal or somehow <BR>&nbsp; "wrong". It is 
simply about time. Time for checks or credit cards to be <BR>&nbsp; cleared or 
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is <BR>&nbsp; 
money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you. <BR><BR>&nbsp; ORDER 
EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER &amp; NAME ONLY. Notes: Always <BR>&nbsp; send $5 cash 
(U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make <BR>&nbsp; sure the 
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of 
<BR>&nbsp; those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER &amp; the NAME of the Report 
you are <BR>&nbsp; ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal 
address. <BR><BR>&nbsp; PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :&nbsp;&nbsp;

orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue <BR>&nbsp; advertising 
or sending e-mails until you do. <BR><BR>&nbsp; **Once you have received 100 or 
more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN <BR>&nbsp; RELAX, because the system is 
already working for you, and the cash will <BR>&nbsp; continue to roll in ! THIS 
IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your <BR>&nbsp; name is moved down on the 
list, you are placed in front of a Different report. <BR><BR>&nbsp; You can KEEP 
TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people <BR>&nbsp; are ordering 
from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME <BR>&nbsp; SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF 
E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE <BR>&nbsp; PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the 
income you can generate from this <BR>&nbsp; business !!!&nbsp;&nbsp; </DIV>

<DIV align=left>&nbsp; FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 
<BR>&nbsp; You have just received information that can give you financial 
freedom for the <BR>&nbsp; rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT 
OF EFFORT. You can <BR>&nbsp; make more money in the next few weeks and months 
than you have ever <BR>&nbsp; imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS 
INSTRUCTED. Do NOT change <BR>&nbsp; it in any way. It works exceedingly well as 
it is now. <BR><BR>&nbsp; Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report 
after you have put your <BR>&nbsp; name and address in Report #1 and moved 
others to #2 .....# 5 as instructed <BR>&nbsp; above. One of the people you send 
this to may send out 100,000 or more <BR>&nbsp; e-mails and your name will be on 
every one of them. Remember though, the more <BR>&nbsp; you send out the more 
potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have <BR>&nbsp; given you 
the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially 
<BR>&nbsp; independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! <BR><BR>&nbsp; =============MORE 
TESTIMONIALS=============== </DIV>
<DIV align=left><BR>&nbsp; '' My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in 
Chicago. I am an <BR>&nbsp; accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make 
pretty good money. <BR>&nbsp; When I received this program I grumbled to Jody 
about receiving ''junk <BR>&nbsp; mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, 
spouting my knowledge of the population <BR>&nbsp; and percentages involved. I 
''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my <BR>&nbsp; supposed 
intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made <BR>&nbsp; 
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her 
<BR>&nbsp; when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks 
she had <BR>&nbsp; received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had 
received total <BR>&nbsp; $ 147,200.00&nbsp; ........ all cash! I was shocked. I 
have joined Jodyin her ''hobby''. <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<EM>Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois <BR></EM>&nbsp; 
================================================ <BR>&nbsp; '' Not being the 
gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my <BR>&nbsp; mind to 
participate in this plan. But conservative as I am, I decided that <BR>&nbsp; 
the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't 
<BR>&nbsp; get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was surprised 
when I <BR>&nbsp; found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I 
made $319,210.00 <BR>&nbsp; in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this 
deal is that it does not <BR>&nbsp; matter where people live. There simply isn't 
a better investment with a faster <BR>&nbsp; return and so big''.&nbsp;

Alberta, Canada <BR></EM>&nbsp; 
================================================= <BR>&nbsp; '' I had received 
this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered <BR>&nbsp; if I should 
have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to <BR>&nbsp; get 
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone <BR>&nbsp; 
else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not 
<BR>&nbsp; delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all 
the <BR>&nbsp; money came within 22 weeks''. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<BR></EM>&nbsp; ================================================= <BR>&nbsp; '' 
It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with <BR>&nbsp; 
little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and <BR>&nbsp; 
within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $ 20, 
<BR>&nbsp; 560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $ 
362,840.00. Life <BR>&nbsp; is beautiful, Thanx to internet''. </DIV>
