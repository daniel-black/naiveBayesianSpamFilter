<b>Jarvis Entertainment Group Releases Ikonboard 3<br>
The Leader in Community Building Software</b><br>
<br>
HOUSTON, Nov. 05, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Internet 
technology and entertainment holding company Jarvis 
Entertainment Group Inc. (Pink Sheets:JRVE) releases Ikonboard 
3 (iB3), the complete community building solution for webmasters. 
After months of careful development, Ikonboard 3 introduces a 
new standard in bulletin board software for both the webmaster 
and web site visitor.<br>
<br>
iB3's built in template and image manager makes full integration 
of the software to an existing design possible without FTP access 
or coding knowledge. iB3 is fully scalable, utilizing the popular 
mySQL database, pgSQL database or DBM flatfiles to ensure 
100% compatibility with existing hardware. In fact, iB3 possesses 
its own database interface, iDatabase, designed specifically to 
handle the complex data exchanges required to process forums, 
without the associated prohibitive cost to users. <br>
<br>
iB3 power features include:<br>
<br><ul>
<li>-- Allows members to choose a language for the board 
interface.
<li>-- Create, Export & Import unique templates and skins from the 
admin control panel.
<li>-- Create, Export & Import language packs, allowing your 
members to choose their native language for the board 
interface.</ul>
<br>
A sampling of other iB3 innovations include:<br>
<br><ul>
<li>-- File management handles permission changes, file 
deletion, renaming & upload.
<li>-- Extensive branding features, multiple templates, forum 
specific skins & templates.
<li>-- Built in news manager for including news topics into any 
page on your web site.
<li>-- Exportable board statistics, showing online members, total 
post & member count on any page.</ul><br>
<br>
"This product raises the bar. We didn't add or copy features for iB3;  
we invented them. Our development team exceeded my wildest 
expectations and in doing so, I think we've reinvented this industry 
segment. Competitors can't touch this product, they can only hope 
to try and emulate it," said John D. Jarvis, President and CEO of 
Jarvis Entertainment Group. "iB3 generates excitement in the 
business to business community because it generates revenue, 
while remaining the most affordable, accessible, feature rich 
community builder software. We're in the pole position; no one can 
touch what we've accomplished. iB3 truly is community 
innovation."<br>
<br>
Ikonboard 3 is the latest version of the Ikonboard series. 
Thousands of webmasters select Ikonboard to develop their 
community, a prestigious clientele including Viacom, Sega, and 
the web site for the popular game "Counter Strike." With advanced 
membergroup features, Ikonboard makes the perfect intranet 
solution for communicating within a corporate development group.
Jarvis Entertainment Group plans to use the Ikonboard engine for 
"myIkonboard," a remotely hosted community building solution 
due for release later this year. <br>
