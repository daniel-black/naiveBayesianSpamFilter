Internet scams, con games, illegal pyramid schemes.
There are so many business opportunities available on the internet,
How do you know which one to pick?

Simple, Let us pick one for you!
My name is Joe Franco and I run a website designed to take 
the guesswork out of choosing an internet business.
My website is dedicated to reviewing, assessing and measuring
the value and performance of internet business opportunities.
We constantly scour the internet looking for opportunities that 
will allow our clients to take advantage of the cyber-space 
goldmine that is the backbone of the internet!

Here at the Success Team Business Club
We rate and review opportunities found on the internet
then present our findings to our clients in the form of a weekly newsletter.
Think of us as a "consumer reports" for internet pioneers
like yourself.

The internet is still growing and is a wild, ungoverned frontier.
While this may sound exciting, it also means that scams and illegal
operations are rampant. This is why we maintain a "black list"
of potential internet scams that should be avoided at all costs.
