Hi  My name is Rich and I would like to share a genuine, NO RISK opportunity 
with you. Skeptical already? Good! 

Unlike other internet opportunities that you might have seen, what I have to 
share with you invites close scrutiny - even with a skeptical eye. It is first 
and foremost a CONSUMER OPPORTUNITY.

It also offers you the ability to have a share of a new Internet Mall to buy 
at wholesale for yourself or to send others to and make commissions on their 
purchases.

Besides this, it also offers a unique and nnovative networking program using 
a principle we call "REFERNET" Marketing. No hyped "pie in the sky" program or 
"get rich quick" scheme, but rather a credible and realistic way to save money 
and gradually develop what can become a large, ongoing income.

The best thing about this opportunity? You can "try it before you buy it". That's 
right. You can join the DHS Club for FREE with no risk or obligation. As a DHS 
Club Member, you will be able to shop at The DHS Club Outlet Center. You will 
also be able to shop at The ClubShop Stores, located in the ClubShop Mall, where 
you will receive rebates on your purchases as per our affinity agreements. (Just 
remember, our affiliate stores are independent merchants and shipping charges 
will vary.)

You will also be able be entered into Postlaunch and receive a FREE position 
in the Club's network. Watch as others join your downline and see how our innovative 
network building program works.

To learn more about the DHS Club and our exciting REFERNET Marketing Program 
and Postlaunch, visit my web page at http://www.rbbrad1.freeservers.com   

Remember, you have nothing to lose and potentially a lot to gain!  Rich Bradley
