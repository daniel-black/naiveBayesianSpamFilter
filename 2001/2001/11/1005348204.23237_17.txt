<p>The Willow-herb, until now hardly found mentioned in herbals, has since the
first publication of this book in the German language started an almost
triumphal march across Europe and even further, as a medicinal herb for
disorders of the <b>prostate gland</b>.</p>
<p>Since there are several species of Willow-herb and some people are uncertain
which are the ones with the medicinal properties I will mention the ones that
can be used:</p>
<b>
<p>Pink Willow-herb</b> (Epilobium parviflorum), <b>Mountain Willow-herb</b> (Epilobium
montanum), <b>Dark-green Willow-herb</b> (Epilobium obscurum), <b>Lance-leaved
Willow-herb</b> (Epilobium lanzeolatum), <b>Hill Willow-herb</b> (Epilobium
collinum), <b>Marsh Willow-herb</b> (Eppilobium palustre, <b>Gravel Willow-herb</b>
(Epilobium anagallidifolium). The Willow-herbs with the colour is reddish, pale
pink to almost white. The flowers stand on thop of the long thin pod-like seed
vessels. These later split, disclosing many silky whites hairs in which are
embedded the tiny seeds.</p>
<p>A chemist in Munich showed me an old pharmacopoeia where it was still
mentioned around 1880. Drugs have pushed it aside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many who suffer from a disorder of the prostate gland are able to find relief
without an operation through the Willow-herb. If an operation has been performed,
the Willow-herb tea relieves the burning and other complaints which often occur
afterwards. But in any case a doctor can be consulted.</p>
<p>In many cases operations can be avoided when Willow Flower herb is
administered first.</p>
<p>Infusion: 1 heaping teaspoon per one or two cups of boiling water, infused for a
short time. Only 2 cups a day are taken, 1 cup in the morning on an empty
stomach, 1 cup in the evening half hour before a meal.</p>
