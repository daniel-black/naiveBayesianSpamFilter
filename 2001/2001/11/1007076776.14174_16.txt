Dear Sir,
                                         REQUEST FOR  ASSISTANCE
 I am the eldest son of  the late Aloys Muzalia Wakyebwa (a foremost human rights activist 
in the Democratic Republic of Congo). My father died in September 2000 as a result of the 
inhumane 
treatment meted out on him while in prison by the RCD Government of Goma and Rwanda 
allies. However, it is particularly important to mention here that before the death of my 
father, he was a 
successful businessman and his business empire includes real estate, exportation,  and 
consultant services which cut across Africa. He was able to accumulate enough money 
both  in local and 
foreign currencies through his business empire.  His entire business has been on the 
upward trend over the past ten years, bringing his net profit during the period under  review 
to twenty eight 
million U.S dollars ($28,000,000). This of course does not include his assets which are 
already running into millions of dollars. Having said all this, there was a twist in my father’s 
success story 
following  his confrontation with the RCD-Goma and Rwandam attack on the Congolese 
people. My father being a human right activist, criticized this attack. This infuriated them 
and he was 
clamped into jail until he died in September. Fortunately, before the arrest of my father, his 
attorney acting upon his instructions, transferred the sum of twenty -eight million U.S dollars 
($28,000,000) from his local banks to a security firm. He did this for fear of this accounts 
being frozen.
 Following my father’s death, the entire family decided to seek political asylum in Lome-
Togo, as the eldest son of my late father and according to our tradition in Africa. I have now 
inherited all my 
father’s wealth. I was then advised by my father’s attorney (presently my attorney) to seek 
the assistance of someone based in your country to receive the amount in question being 
($28,000,000). 
Since I have the intention of relocating my family there with the aim of settling down there 
and investing. I have decided to give you 10% of the $28,000.000.
To finalize this transaction you will have to contact me via my e-mail. Further discussions will 
be centered on how and when we shall be meeting. I shall expect you to keep this 
transaction 
confidential due to the present circumstance of my family. 
I urgently await your response.

Yours faithfully 

Anthony . Muzalia
