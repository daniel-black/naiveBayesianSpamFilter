<br><i><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Do you have an over-weight problem
that you can't seem to beat?&nbsp;<b> Have you tried diet after diet with
no results?</b></font></font></i>
<br><b><i><font color="#009900"><font size=+2>Are you too busy to buy special
diet foods?&nbsp; Do you want a simple, quick one-pound-a-day diet that
gets you really slim, really fast?</font></font></i></b>
<p>The One-Pound-A-Day Diet is so simple and so fast, <b>you can lose a
whole dress size every week</b>.&nbsp; ie:&nbsp; Men can go from size 40
to 38 the first week, to size 36 the second week, to size 34 etc.&nbsp;
Women can go from size 16 the first week to size 14 the second week, 12
the next and 10 the next and on down if they wish.
<p><font color="#000000">On the One-Pound-A-Day Diet, <b><u>you will immediately
notice that your clothes seem too big.</u></b>&nbsp; After the second week,
they will be falling off you and you will be forced to go out and buy new
clothes two sizes smaller.&nbsp; In four weeks, you will have to go out
and buy new clothes four sizes smaller.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">The main problem with most diets is that you either
suffer from hunger, get discouraged and quit, or you lose weight so slowly
that you get tired of "dieting" and quit. Other problems with diets are
all the exotic foods you are required to go out and buy.&nbsp; You have
to study the diet each day and run out to the store because each day is
different.&nbsp; This becomes too time-consuming for a busy person so you
give up.&nbsp; The One-Pound-A-Day Diet is so fast that you don't have
time to get discouraged and quit.&nbsp; Nor do you suffer from hunger.&nbsp;
Nor do you run to the store all the time.</font><b><font color="#993300">You
will have higher energy than normal, be constantly full, and you will have
excellent nutrition.</font></b>&nbsp; And, by the way, this is NOT a fad
diet that pretends you can get slim eating all the pizza and icecream you
wish.&nbsp; (This diet is not pills)
<p>The following are letters from our customers:
<p><font color="#009900">Dear Sir:</font>
<p><b><font color="#009900">I was a size 14 and had just started a new
job where I had to look nice.&nbsp; I was very busy and had no time to
do special shopping so I chose your "One-Pound-A-Day Diet".&nbsp; In just
one week I had gone to a size 12.&nbsp; In two weeks I was a size 10!&nbsp;
Before having two children, I had once been size 10 so I was able to bring
out all my old size 10 clothes and wear them again.&nbsp; In fact, this
diet was so easy for my busy schedule and it made me feel so strong and
energetic, that I just kept on it without thinking. Well, I went down to
size 8!!&nbsp; One day, I happened to be standing in front of my boss's
desk and he exclaimed.&nbsp; Boy, Amanda, are you ever skinny!&nbsp; My
husband started to get worried and instead of nagging me to lose weight,
he started to hand me fattening foods.&nbsp; I stayed at size 8 after that
and had no trouble keeping that weight.&nbsp; Amanda C.</font></b>
<p><font color="#3333FF">Dear One Pound-A-Day people:</font>
<p><b><font color="#3366FF">I had been overweight for years and tried every
diet possible only to give up.&nbsp; I found diets that promised 2 pounds
a week too slow for me.&nbsp; I would get discouraged around Friday because
I was starving and weak so I would go off it for a day and binge and gain
back in one day the two pounds I was supposed to lose that week. I would
then get discouraged and binge the whole weekend.&nbsp; On Monday, I would
start again.&nbsp; I would be good all week and keep to the diet, but somehow,
on the weekend I would relent and gain back the two pounds!&nbsp; I found
that the "two pounds per week diets" too slow and discouraging for me.&nbsp;
When I came across your "One-Pound-A-Day Diet, I thought, Wow, that is
what I need! It is the only diet that worked.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#3366FF">I was 230 pounds for years, but after going
on your "One-Pound-A-Day-Diet", I noticed the difference the second day!&nbsp;
On the 7th day I was 223 pounds (just like you said) and the 14th day I
was 216 pounds.&nbsp; In 1 1/2 months, I was down to 185.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#3366FF">I had lost 50 pounds in 50 days.&nbsp; And
the best part was that I was a big eater.&nbsp; Your diet REQUIRED me to
eat a huge dinner!</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#3366FF">Around about the 185 mark, I noticed girls
who had previously not noticed me started to flirt with me!&nbsp; I now
have a girl friend.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#3366FF">Thank you!&nbsp; I couldn't have done it without
you!</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#3333FF">Another thing I might mention is that I have
spent hundreds of dollars joining weight loss clinics with no satisfaction.&nbsp;
Your cost of $39.99 was a very small price to pay for the number of pounds
I lost and kept off.&nbsp; You have been extremely fair in my opinion.</font></b>
<p><font color="#3366FF">Very sincerely,&nbsp; Ryan from Windsor.</font>
<p>This diet even gives you some really<font color="#CC33CC"> <b>great
tasting easy recipies </b></font>to keep your interest high and the calories
low.
<p>Here is an excerpt from the "ONE POUND A DAY" DIET:
<p>"If you love spaghetti, this diet allows you to have it once a week.&nbsp;
Have only 1 extra-lean meatball.&nbsp; Parmesan cheese is OK.&nbsp; The
only stipulation for this meal is that you make a huge caesar salad and
eat it first.&nbsp; You cannot have the spaghetti unless you have the salad
first.&nbsp; The reason for this is that you will fill up on the salad
and eat less of the spaghetti.&nbsp; Plus the ruffage in the salad speeds
the spaghetti through your system before you can absorb the calories.&nbsp;
Caesar Salad goes extremely well with spaghetti, so we have included a
low-calorie Caesar to make it easy for you.
<p><b><font color="#CC33CC">Low-cal Caesar Salad for two:</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><b><font color="#CC33CC">1 romaine lettuce:&nbsp; (leaves washed
and blotted dry with a towel)</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC33CC">Juice of 1 or 2 lemons,</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC33CC">1 tablespoon dijonnaise or dijon mustard</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC33CC">1 teaspoon malt vinegar or 1 tablespoon apple
cider vinegar</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC33CC">6 to 10 fat cloves of garlic squeezed through
a garlic press</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC33CC">1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC33CC">&nbsp;cayenne, black pepper and salt.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC33CC">1 tablespoon olive oil, or 1/2 cup Hellman's
light mayonnaise</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC33CC">parmesan cheese</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC33CC">croutons (just a few), artificial bacon bits.
Toss &amp; serve immediately.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC33CC">Note:&nbsp; You can also put all dressing
ingredients in a food processor</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#CC33CC">or blender if you don't have a garlic press.</font></b></blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><br>This is an extremely good tasting caesar and I guarantee you will
be crazy about it!
<p>and another excerpt:
<p><font color="#000000">This diet is unique and different from all other
diets in that it has been carefully prepared using the nutritional content
of foods as the primary focus.&nbsp; The vitamin and mineral content of
each food item has been carefully selected to give</font><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>
THE</font></font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1><font color="#FF0000">HIGHEST POSSIBLE VITAMIN CONTENT,
BUT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF CALORIES.</font><font color="#000000">&nbsp;
(</font></font></b><font color="#000000">no pills to take)&nbsp; The aim
has been to go very heavy on foods high in vitamins A, B, and C and especially
iron while excluding high carbohydrate and high fat foods which give one
"empty calories".&nbsp; The average American diet unfortunately has been
the opposite.&nbsp; Extremely high in "empty calories" and intollerably
low in high vitamin foods.&nbsp; That is why people feel lazy and sluggish
preferring to sit in front of TV. Iron is the mineral that makes you feel
strong.&nbsp; Taken in the morning, you will feel stronger all day."</font>
