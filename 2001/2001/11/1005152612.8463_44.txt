      Holdings, Inc. is a robust company that is
focused on the international 
      travel market and serves business, leisure and
student travelers by 
      providing international cell-phone rentals at
the lowest possible price. 
      UniverCell currently maintains 7.5% of the
business market, 7.8% of the 
      leisure market and 15% of the student market
overseas. UniverCell intends 
      to increase these market shares as well as their
profit margins through 
      strategic agreements, mergers and
acquisitions.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; UniverCell 
      uses Motorola phones exclusively and they have
agreements with hundreds of 
      independent travel agencies whose business spans
the

exclusive agreement with 
      the French Tourist Board as well as pending
agreements with American 
      Express, TravelSavers and Omnitel, the exclusive
provider of cellular 
      service in Italy.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The
cell-phone rental industry has 
      a $2 billion potential within a 3-5 year period;
and, with increased 
      dependence on cell-phones, UniverCell will take
advantage of an increasing 
      awareness among international travelers that a
cell-phone can be easily 
      rented for international
use.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; UniverCell's total 
      projected revenues for 2002 are $20 million, an
increase of more than 
      1200% over the 2001 projected revenue of $1.5
million, and by 2005 
      conservative projections put UniverCell's
revenue at $124 million-total 
      revenue growth of an additional 520% over
2002.</FONT></P>
