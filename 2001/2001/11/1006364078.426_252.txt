URGENT:  HOT ANTI-TERRORISM PLAY

OTCBB: KWNR and US Government Agencies team up to combat Anthrax!

With the completion of the Proton Laboratories aquisition, KWNR appears
poised to benefit tremendously from the $50 Billion pledged by the
United States to fight Bio-Terrorism.

TRADING ALERT: KWNR has been experiencing very heavy trading volume,
indicating that knowledgable investors are loading up on KWNR shares.
As news of further developements are released, this stock could
