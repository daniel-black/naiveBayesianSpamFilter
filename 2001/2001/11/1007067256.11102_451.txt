  “The Best Story You’ve Never Heard”<br>
  <br>
  <u><b>THE COMPANY</b></u><br>
  <br>
  E-Smart Technologies, Inc., (ESMT), <a href="http://www.e-smarttechnologies.com">www.e-smarttechnologies.com</a>
  is a company that we believe is in the right place at the right time. E-Smart(OTC:ESMT)
  holds technology licenses for the “Super Smart Card System™”, which uses
  proprietary microchips, with biometric fingerprint sensors and software that
  allows multiple applications to co-exist on a single card. The system provides
  a high level of security and incorporates a “Personal Identity Protection
  System™” (“PIPS”) that supplies absolute identity authentication for
  its user.&nbsp; This makes for an ideal “Sure Pass” for use to get into
  secured areas such as airports and power plants and can be used for all credit
  card systems.&nbsp; More than $50 million dollars was spent developing the
  technology used by the “Super Smart Card System”. ESMT holds the exclusive
  license agreement for the “Super Smart Card System” in Asia and the United
  States<br>
  <br>
  <u><b>THE OPPORTUNITY</b></u><br>
  <br>
  We believe that because of the events that took place on September 11th, the
  “Super Smart Card System™”, will not only fill its original application
  agenda as a multi-application all purpose smart card for multiple markets, but
  will now fulfill an additional and now essential responsibility under
  “Homeland Protection”. The Company recently announced the formation of a
  new wholly owned subsidiary, Homeland Defense, Inc. to market the “Super
  Smart Card System” throughout the U.S. Also, recently announced was a low
  cost biometric fingerprint authentication solution for secure airline
  e-ticketing and boarding, There is current debate over a national smart card
  ID system that may implemented in some fashion soon. Some of its many
  proponents are Oracle’s Larry Ellison and Washington lawmakers Feinstein and
  Kyl. ESMT’s “PIPS” system, which is far less invasive to an individuals
  privacy, has been heralded. The potential smart card market could be over $3
  billion dollars! In related news, the US Defense Department has ordered smart
  technology ID cards for 4.3 million military personnel. ESMT plans to finalize
  their production arrangements and begin rolling out Super Smart Cards early in
  2002. Potential monthly revenue based on 1 million cards and an average
  spending of $72 dollars per year, per card with transaction fees of $0.20 per
  day, are $430 million, with $4 to $6 per share in earnings.&nbsp; Using a
  Price Earnings Ratio of 20 puts ESMT between $80 and $120 per share –
  considerably higher than the current price of under $1. The numbers can be
  staggering and we believe our opinion is conservative! WE are basing the above
  on only two daily transactions per card average. Recently, ESMT formed an
  alliance with one of the 10 largest security firms in the US, to market the
  “Super Smart Card System™”. They employ over 7000 people, have a
  national presence and are the largest court security officer contractor to the
  US Marshals Service. We believe this to be the first of many significant
  alliances.(See Recent Press Release for more Details)<br>
  <br>
  <u><b>ASIAN OPPORTUNITIES</b></u><br>
  <br>
  In September 2001, the Company signed joint venture with a company primarily
  owned and controlled by one of the largest ministries in China that regulates
  all smart cards and applications. China’s government is actively seeking to
  implement a secure, “one-card for all” system. ESMT is also currently in
  negotiations with private entities and governments of two other Asian
  countries and the World Bank for implementation of the “Super Smart Card
  System” in those countries. We look for a tremendous amount of corporate
  developments in the next few months and anticipate a significantly higher
  price. The potential deals in China and Asia, if successfully concluded could
  generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and profit over the next
  several years. In Europe and Asia Smart Cards are already a way of life.&nbsp;
  The industry is growing daily. This is not a trend! This is the Future! ESMT
  has the premier technology. Opportunity abounds for smart and aggressive
  investors!<br>
