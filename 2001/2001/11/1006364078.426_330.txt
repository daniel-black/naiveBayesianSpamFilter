Hi
Let me first state that this program is awesome and I can assure you that you wouldn't regret being a part of.

The returns are tremendously great!!
PLEASE GIVE IT A CHANCE. All you need to know is written hear in this
one email so be patient.

THE PROGRAM!
PHASE ONE

This program is to make money via the power of the Internet - quickly and 
honestly!

It is quite new, yet already proven to be most effective. It is truly 
exciting, with many
people now using it, and with so many more still to see it!
It is not the same as other programs that (only at first) may seem to be 
similar.
This program has been designed to avoid all of the traps and all of the 
cheats.
It is also a lot of fun, with nothing to lose!

And ... You can quickly prove that it is both real and safe, before you
decide to participate.

NOTE: Please read this complete document to be sure that you fully 
understand it.
Take the time to read it again and again if you have to.

E-mail me with any questions if you remain unsure of anything. Should you 
decide
to run it, by following the instructions carefully, you will be delighted 
with the results!


PHASE 1 BEGINS - Prepare to be impressed!

This program is very powerful -- a real money generator on the World Wide 
Web! No other program
comes close when you need money quickly and honestly. You are guaranteed 
financial success
with this opportunity because of the method used to CONFIRM the HONESTY of 
each participant.

However, when most of us first look at this program, we may think it's just 
another
"get rich quick" scheme. But it isn't -- by reading the details you will see 
that it
is quite different. And ... only about a week after starting, your inbox 
will be overwhelmed
with responses. A few weeks later, money will start rolling in quickly -- 
from all over the world!

This is a FAIL-SAFE money making program where all cash receipts are 
verifiable in advance,
because:

Every participant is held¨ ACCOUNTABLE

Every participant gets paid well¨

Every participant is sure that nobody can cheat

That is why I chose to participate. I invite you to do likewise. Being 
fail-safe and cheat-proof,
what have we got to lose? The power of the Internet is here to be used. More 
and more people are
using this program to produce a substantial income quickly.

Expect to earn up to US $40,000 in the next six weeks (MAXIMUM TIME).

We all know that Internet money programs can really work, but most of us 
have major concerns
about them:

1. They are too complex, often requiring large investments.

2. They require real Internet marketing experience.

3. There is usually no way of monitoring returns.

4. There is no way of eliminating cheaters.

This program solves all of those concerns!

It is 100% certain that everyone will get paid for participating. This is 
because we require
accountable e-mail addresses for all participants. The total cost to you is 
two US $5 Bills,
plus postage for just two letters. (Not a lot, no matter what your present
circumstances may be.) But you spend nothing at all, until you gain e-mail 
confirmation that
the sender of this letter has paid!

Please read this carefully. If you have any questions, feel free to contact 
me by replying to my
e-mail address, as the sender of this letter.

NOTE: US Postal Service Lottery Codes: Title 18, Sections 1302 and 1341 
state that this service
is legal, because we are building a MAILING LIST. The postal service's phone 
number to call and
verify this information in the US is: 1-800-725-2161.

The fail-safe mechanism controls the program, so it's impossible for anyone 
to cheat.
This way nobody gets hurt and everyone gets paid. All participants make the 
money they
deserve for their efforts.

Read on and you will see why...

The method of accountability used keeps everyone honest. We all get our 
money by building an
easy and valuable MAILING LIST. Too many programs (before this one) have no 
fail-safe method for
protecting the honest participants from those who put their names on a list 
without sending
any money. That is what causes such programs to ultimately fail, even though 
some people may
have done quite well from them. With this program, it is IMPOSSIBLE FOR SUCH 
CHEATING TO HAPPEN.

If you decide to participate, you will be required to send $5 (US currency) 
to just two of the
people on the list shown below, with a note asking them to add your name on 
to their mailing
list.

More about that shortly -- First take the time to SAVE this letter to a file
so that you can edit the prescribed areas later if you do decide to join in.

Check the honesty first...

The very first step is to e-mail the two people in the Position #1 and 
Position #2 from the
current Accountability List below, and ask them if they received their $5 
from me.
This is what MAKES CERTAIN the success of this program. You will not send 
money to me until
you KNOW that I have paid the people in Positions 1 and 2.


POSITION #1
James Allen
St. Patrick's, Michaelson Rd
Barrow in Furness
Cumbria LA14 2RJ
United Kingdom

Email: Leonmees@hotmail.com



POSITION #2

Len Cummins
Skeetes Road, Jackmans
St. Michael
Barbados, W.I.


Email: ellowecee@hotmail.com






*The above are the two people I sent my US $5 to, with a note asking them to 
add me to
their mailing lists. After you have verified that I am genuine and decide to 
participate....

Address an envelope to the person currently in Position #3 (me), put a $5 
bill (US Currency),
your name, address, and e-mail address included, on a note that reads 
"Please add my name to
your Mailing List and rush Phase 2 to me by e-mail."

NOTE: Only the person in Position #3 supplies Phase 2, NEVER any other
person.

POSITION #3
Norman Leonard
9 Grovedale St.
Warwick, RI 02888
Email;  Wrldtrade@aol.com

Next...
Address an envelope to the person in Position #4; enclose a $5 bill, your 
name,
address and e-mail address with a note that states "please add me to your 
mailing list."

POSITION #4

John Bertucci
P.O. Box 45898
Baton Rouge, LA  70895

Email: mailto:money@jjbweb.com



NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS EDIT YOUR COPY OF THIS LETTER, AS FOLLOWS:

FIRST: move the person currently in POSITION #4 to POSITION #2. Be sure all 
information is copied correctly and completely. (The person originally in 
Position #2 is now dropped from the list.)

SECOND: move the person in POSITION #1 to POSITION #4 with all the correct 
information.

THIRD: move the person in POSITION #3 to POSITION #1 with all the correct 
information.

FINALLY: enter YOUR name, complete address, and e-mail address in to 
POSITION #3.

Please also provide your name and e-mail address at the end of this letter.

Remember: you only send the $5 to the names in POSITIONS #3 and #4 on
this letter.


DO NOT SEND MONEY TO THE NAMES IN POSITIONS 1 AND 2.


NOTE: When typing your e-mail address, please remember to be accurate.
Double check!

Once you start, there are two simple things you must do to make this work 
for the maximum
return in 30-45 days.

1. In Phase 2, you will e-mail wherever you can and, if you really want to 
bring in the
money, advertise. I have everything you need to advertise such as samples, 
tips, and lots of
links to free classified advertising on the Internet. When you are added to 
my mailing list,
I will send this to you... If you need further help from there, just ask me.
2. BE PATIENT at the start! It takes easily a week or so to really get up 
and going, and to
start receiving lots of replies in your e-mail. BUT THEY WILL COME!
This is the Internet! The money will come also!

YOU WILL DEFINITELY MAKE A LARGE SUM OF MONEY WITHIN A FEW WEEKS, and you 
will also have a
mailing list service to use yourself, or even to sell. That, in itself, can 
be valuable.

THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO MAKE MONEY FAST! It is very INEXPENSIVE to 
participate in ...
compare it to the value of lottery tickets -- where making money is next to 
impossible! There
are no postage expenses, other than the two stamps needed to mail your two 
$5 bills.
If any of the addresses require overseas mailing, do it via airmail for 
speed -- and
think of the power of the program running internationally! There are no name 
lists, nor
other unseen expenses. Other than the two initial letters, this program 
operates totally on-line.



FURTHER INFORMATION:

You may already feel that this program is not what you thought at first, but 
still remain
doubtful or a little unclear about whether or not to have a go. Unlike so 
many other programs,
you do not send money to four or five people for reports, recipes, disks, or 
any other product.
Nor do you risk losing your time and money. This program is less demanding 
and does not take
advantage of the naive. Effectively, we all become a team -- we know that we 
must follow the
rules, and that our teamwork ensures that we all "win."

To compare this with the many uncontrolled programs:

First of all, this program has only four controlled, levels -- not five, six, 
seven, or more
uncontrolled levels like other programs. When you first send this program 
out, you will soon
get 40-50 people who send you $5 to join the mailing list and to commence 
their Phase 2.
They will do this only after they confirm that you have paid your $10.

To account for "curiosity seekers" and people who don't recognize the 
opportunity
(not you, of course)! Let's say that only 20 people then actually pursue 
the program provided.
These 20 people then put your name in the Accountability List POSITION #1, 
and their respondents
will be asking YOU if they paid their $5 dollars.
Their active participants will then move your name to POSITION #4, WHERE YOU 
WILL BE RECEIVING $5
notes from 20 x 20 x 20 people.

That's a total of 8,000 people. 8000 X $5 = US $40,000! Because this is done 
only on the
Internet it moves very quickly.

Therefore, you only need 20 ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS who actually promote this 
program to reach the
target. You should advertise/e-mail until twice that number of people 
(40-50) have sent you
the $5 and received Phase 2 from you via e-mail. At this point, all you will 
have to do will be
to answer the e-mails saying: "Yes, I have been paid".

NOTE: Be sure to keep a record of those who have paid and added to your 
mailing list, and
respond very quickly to verification requests via e-mail.

Remember that you may send this program to people who send you similar" 
programs. Many such
people are keen and active users of opportunities sent to them, and this one 
is safe, fast and
simple.
It will not appeal to cheats, yet be great for anyone looking for a VERY low 
cost, fun
investment. Just keep sending as much e-mail as you possibly can!
You will be amazed with the responses you get from the Web.
The Internet is a powerful tool.
But remember: we are responsible to the "team." That means to everyone who 
participates ... both
before and after we become involved.


SUMMARY OF THE SIMPLE STEPS TO FOLLOW:

FIRST: Save this file as your PHASE 1 file, where you can edit the changes
(names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and position #'s).

SECOND: Get two US $5 bills and mail by post ($5 each) to the people listed 
above in
Positions 3 and 4, with a request to join the mailing list.
Note: that cost is your ONLY financial risk!

THIRD: Update the names on the list carefully, as detailed above. YOUR name, 
address and e-mail
address comes in at Position #3 (where mine is now). You then wait for PHASE 
2 to arrive in your
e-mail box from me.
This will be sent the same day that your $5 arrives at my home address.



HOW YOUR NAME MOVES THROUGH THE SYSTEM:

First

- Your name starts at Position #3 in Phase 1 - to all of the people you 
e-mail.

- You would aim to get about 40 responses, but more would be even more 
profitable!

Second

- You will e-mail PHASE 2 out to each person who has sent you $5.

- You will be instructing your respondents to place your name in POSITION #1 
- You will begin
receiving inquiries from others asking if you have been paid your $5.

- You will be keeping track of all those who have paid you.

- You won't be receiving much money at this stage (just the $5 you received 
from each person
in Phase 1, which will be from $200-$250 or so).

Third

Those people who have just inquired as to whether payment was made to you, 
will be getting
another 20 or more people to participate, and your name will then be in 
POSITION #4. This is
when you will receive the BIG MONEY.

Last

Your name will be in Position #2, where you will again be receiving 
inquiries, and you will be
likely to answer at this point "YES, I, AM, RICHER." Many will then 
participate and make
money also.
Participation is all that we require for success.

Isn't this a brilliant business? We really have the best, because we have 
created a foolproof
and cheat-proof system, where everybody has accountability.
Your small investment of two $5 bills will reward you with $40,000 or more!

Once again, please e-mail me if you have any questions.

"None of us are able to go back for a new beginning.
But, we learn and grow, so all of us are able to make a new anything. Just 
do it!"

Good fortune to you -- and have fun!

NOTE: $10 is a very small investment for what you will get in return.
(This reminds me of those fun football pools that go around at work.)
