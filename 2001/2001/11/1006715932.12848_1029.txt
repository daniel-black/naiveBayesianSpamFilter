<P>
By Mary Travis,<br> 
Special feature writer<br> 
(Canfield, OH)<P> 
Is there a painless way for people to lose weight? Yes! HUNZA DIET BREAD is being hailed as the weight loss method of the century. The bread is a duplicate of a 2,000-year-old recipe used 
by the little known civilization of Hunza. 
<P>
The Hunzas are considered to be the healthiest people on earth. Their bread is the main part of their diet. This bread is absolutely delicious. Everybody loves it. But then a startling discovery 
was made. Just one or two slices of this bread would suppress a person's appetite for 4 to 6 hours! Could this be a designed bread invented thousands of years ago? 
<P>
There are facts being uncovered that support a theory that this bread was designed in ancient times for the express purpose of tiding people over when food supplies were scarce. Let's start 
with the Hunzas who are exceptionally trim, fit and the healthiest people on earth. Many consider their bread to be one of the main reasons for the extraordinary health of the Hunzas. 
<P>
Here is a little background of the Hunzas from a feature story which has been published in many major newspapers throughout North America. This is an excerpt from the article: 
<P>
"The Hunzas exist isolated from the rest of the world in the Himalayan Mountains where they live to be 110 to 120 years of age. They have no cancer, heart attacks or other major disorders to 
speak of. They are active and fit to the end of their lives. Men father children at 100 years of age and older. Overweight people are unheard of because they have the perfect weight control 
system." 
<P>
The story then relates research and fact finding visits to Hunza by such notables as Queen Elizabeth, Art Linkletter, N.B.C., The National Geographic Magazine, Frank Shor, Lowell Thomas Jr. 
and Chou En Lai of China. Visitors to Hunza all came back with the same identical description of the Hunza people: 
<P>
"Hunza men are straight, tall, broad-shouldered, deep-chested, slim-waisted, heavy-legged and have full heads of hair. Hunza women are straight, tall, slim-waisted, developed bosoms, perfect 
complexions and luxuriant hair. Both men and women have perfect teeth and eyesight even at 100 years of age and older! They are neat, clean, intelligent and friendly and you can't find an 
overweight person. 
<P>
Hunza women at 80 look no older than North American women of 40. Fatigue is virtually unknown. Hunza men over 90 years old repeatedly walk the mountain trail of 65 miles from the town of 
Gilgit with a full pack and immediately start to work in the fields again!" 
<P>
We feel that the Hunza bread may be "by design" both a hunger suppressant and a super health food. It is a simple, nutritious bread that is easily prepared in just 5 minutes using a few 
ingredients that have always been universally available and the taste is wonderful.
<P>
The Hunzas were originally soldiers of Alexander the Great. This bread may have been designed for the use of his far traveling armies. It would make sense. It's the most compact form of 
hunger satisfaction and nutrition we know of. According to traces of Macedonian Heritage, this bread could have originated in Egypt over 5,000 years ago. As you know, the Egyptians were 
capable of doing many things that modern science cannot, even today, duplicate. 
<P>
We are convinced that the Hunza bread is one of the major reasons for the good health of the Hunzas. 
<P>
Both my husband and I started using the bread as a weight loss device and began losing weight consistently, much faster than any weight loss method we ever tried, and, we have tried them 
all believe me. Exactly how does the HUNZA DIET BREAD compare to some of the fad diets such as liquid protein? 
<P>
There's no comparison. Fad diets are not only ineffective, they may be downright dangerous. When I say they are ineffective I mean; that either a person will not stick with them because they 
are uncomfortable or when the diet is over they'll put the weight right back on. Because bread is part of our culture this diet is never over. HUNZA DIET BREAD becomes our bread substitute 
not only because it helps control our weight but because it is so delicious and easy to prepare.
<P>
All of us lifetime dieters know of the miseries of the high protein and liquid protein (or milkshake) diets. They seem okay for the first few days, then they become repulsive. You get "full" on 
these diets but not satisfied. Let me tell you about the advantages of HUNZA DIET BREAD. The biggest benefit I can think of is that the dieter just doesn't suffer AT ALL! It's such a natural 
and powerful appetite inhibitor. This bread is not only healthful and delicious but you will appreciate its simplicity and lack of extraneous ingredients. 
<P>
This bread satisfies both appetite and hunger. And it does it with only 100 calories as effectively as most 1800 calorie full meals. 
<P>
We define appetite and hunger like this: appetite is mainly the desire you get for food even when you know you're really not hungry. It's that craving in your mouth you get that's known as the 
cold mouth feeling. It can also be present even though you've just eaten. Your stomach may be full but you still crave something else. This is the feeling you get with a protein diet. You can 
stuff yourself with protein until you're ready to burst but the cold mouth craving is still there. 
<P>
Hunger on the other hand is best described as those pangs of hunger you get or that empty feeling in your stomach that lets you know you really need to eat something rather than simply 
wanting to eat for the enjoyment of it. 
<P>
After a slice or two of HUNZA DIET BREAD you eliminate both appetite and hunger. You feel satisfied and full and it lasts, depending on the person, up to 7 hours. For me it lasts 5 to 7 hours. 
<P>
Not only is the bread nutritional, but it contains some proven good health producing roughage or fiber. It passes through your digestive system quickly so the actual absorbed calories are less. 
You also become very regular eating this bread and it tastes better than any bread that we've ever eaten. 
<P>
Now, here's what its like hour by hour after you eat the bread. 
<P>
Hour 1 and 2. Each minute after you finish eating the bread seems like a build-up of a "fullness" feeling. It's just as though you have kept on eating. You keep getting fuller and fuller. Both your 
appetite and hunger are very satisfied. You don't crave anything more. 
<P>
Hour 3. In hour 3 something else happens. The thought of food just doesn't appeal to you. It's not an unpleasant experience, quite the opposite. But, you don't have a desire for food in any 
way, shape or form. 
<P>
Hour 4. You no longer have a feeling of being stuffed or turned off by the thought of eating, but there's a kind of nothing feeling. You don't want to eat, and you don't crave anything. It's just 
as I said, a sort of comfortable "nothing" stage. 
<P>
Hour 5 through 7. Toward the end of the 5th hour you begin to get mildly hungry which then slowly increases into the 6th and 7th hour. 
<P>
All of this for only the cost of 100 to 200 calories .You can't get that performance out of an 1800 calorie meal. 
<P>
Here's another little known thing about standard lunch hours and dinners. Let's say you eat a milk shake, hamburger and french fries for lunch. That's over a 1,000 calories. There's a lot of 
sugar and salt in that meal. When you're done the first thing that happens is that your body shoots a large amount of insulin into your system to counteract the sugar. The insulin lowers your 
blood sugar and within an hour you feel hungry again and start snacking. On top of that the salt has made you thirsty and you gulp water or soft drinks and retain the fluids. 
<P>
On the other hand, if you try a weight watchers lunch, or similar balanced diet, you'd have to eat between 400 to 600 calories of cottage cheese, lean meat, and eggs to feel reasonably full, 
but you would not be satisfied and almost immediately you'd be hungry again and need to consume more of the same. You can't win. <P>You will feel better and look better after you start 
eating this bread. When you take a bite of the HUNZA DIET BREAD the delicious taste of the bread fills your mouth. You can tell that it is hearty, full of substance, chewy and good for you. 
Perhaps our bodies trigger an instinct that lets us know what's good or bad for us. <P>HUNZA DIET BREAD is indeed the best bread I have ever tasted. The bread is out of this world. It just 
gives you what you crave. We decided to simply publish the recipe for anyone who'd like to make it at home. The amazing thing is that it only takes 5 minutes to prepare. I am sure you will
