Dear Future Entrepreneur

So much negativism out there. From our earliest days of childhood all we seemed to hear is "you cant" or "thats too hard" or "live within your means" or "stop dreaming big dreams". Ill make you a promise .....
SAVE THIS REPORT, PRINT A COPY, GET IN YOUR FAVORITE CHAIR, READ IT TO THE END, READ IT AGAIN, AND DARE TO DREAM. Follow what it says and you will not worry about who is in the Whitehouse, recessions, job cuts, the Federal Reserve, or other issues.

You hear those voices? Remember the voices from your past, be-littling you and knocking down your dreams? They are telling you not to read this. They are telling you to quit before you even try. THATS THE PAST SPEAKING. And if you think hard you'll probably recognize who those voices belong too. Someone near you who probably had the same thing told to them years ago. Its a vicious cycle...Maybe an ex spouse or boy or girlfriend? Someone at work who is lazy and un-motivated? Hey misery loves company right? ITS TIME TO PUT THAT TO REST. No more worrying about the chains of the past....LOOK TO YOUR FUTURE.

One day I just said "what the heck". I throw away $25.00 on stuff I dont ever need or use. I responded to an e-mail message I received a day earlier. I thank goodness I broke away from those negative voices and took my future into my hands. I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing now had I not looked towards my future. Please read on....Its all true....Every word....The program is legitimate (its not legal one of those voices will say)....You will begin to buy and sell "INFORMATION"....something of great value....something requiring no inventories....something requiring no paperwork....something requiring no employees....something requiring only your.......IMAGINATION

BECOME A FINANCIALLY INDEPENDANT INTERNET MARKETER USING EMAIL AND ADS

As was recently documented on a weekly national TV program using the above slogan, the producers devoted the entire broadcast to investigating the program including legitimacy as well as the ability to generate significant amounts of income for those who dared to dream.
Their findings added an amount of legitimacy to the program that can only be had on a national program. IT WORKS and ITS LEGAL. (Theres that voice again telling you the only people who can make large amounts of money are doing something wrong). Their findings quash the arguments of the "dragger downers" as "absolutely NO laws prohibit the participation in the marketing of the information and if a person can follow the simple instructions in the reports they receive, they will make significant incomes with only a $25.00 initial investment". (U.S. funds only)

NATIONAL EXPOSURE HAS INCREASED THE POPULARITY OF THIS PROGRAM TENFOLD.

This is what one participant said: "Thanks for this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I always
found an excuse and passed on it. I am so glad I finally broke through and listened to myself instead of others who were so negative. I joined to see what one could expect in return for the minimal amount of time and the $25.00 needed to start. I am still amazed I received a total of $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still comming in".
Mrs. Pam Hedland
Fort Lee, New Jersey

Another said: "This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. My friends and co workers talked me out of participating. But one day I decided to invest my $25.00 because it seemed like such a small amount of money as compared to how much I waste on other items I dont need. So far in the past 33 weeks I have made over $700,000.00 and I am still continuing to market through e-mail and ads. THE KEY TO SUCCESS IN THIS PROGRAM IS TO FOLLOW YOUR OWN VISION AND TO FOLLOW THE SIMPLE STEPS AND NOT CHANGE THE PROGRAM IN ANY WAY".
Miss Cheryl Bartko

MORE TESTIMONIALS LATER BUT NOW FOR THE GOOD STUFF....THE PROGRAM!

Can you envision yourself producing an income of $500,000.00 or more in the next 25-52 weeks comfortably.

Even better can you envision telling the owners of all of those negative voices from the past to "stick it" because you are now living on easy street?

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS TO START YOUR DREAM.

1) Order all 5 of the SPECIAL REPORTS shown on the mailing list below.

2) For each report send $5.00 CASH. The NAME AND NUMBER of the report
   and your E-MAIL ADDRESS the report is to be sent to. Include a
   return postal address and send it all to the marketer whose name and
   address appears next to the report you are ordering. Again no checks
   or credit cards please. (More on why not later.)(US funds only)

3) You will have 5 envelopes each with a $5.00 bill and each addressed
   to the individual marketer whose name and address appears by the
   respective report on this list.

4) You need to order ALL 5 of the reports.

5) Within a few days of ordering you will start to receive the
   individual reports in your e-mail inbox from the marketers you have
   sent the $5.00 to. (US funds only).

6) Save them on your computer and back them up on disk so they will be
   accessible to you for your use in your e-mail and add marketing
   campaign. (The reports spell out in specific language how you will
   market the reports to your prospective customers. No vague language
   or untried or loosing techniques as all of our successes depends on
   the successes of each other.)

7) IMPORTANT. Do not alter the names or the sequences of the people or
   addresses that appear below. You WILL ALTER them only AFTER you have
   ordered all of your reports as described in steps 8A-F. Once you
   understand how the program works, you will also see how it does not
   work. Altering the instructions may affect your potential income.
   Follow the program exactly as outlined.

8A)After you have ordered all five reports take this advertisement
   and remove the name and address of the marketer in REPORT 5. This
   person has made it all the way through and is partying on EZ STREET.

8B)Move the name and address of the marketer in report #4 to report#5.

8C)Move the name and address of the marketer in report #3 to report#4.

8D)Move the name and address of the marketer in report #2 to report#3.

8E)Move the name and address of the marketer in report #1 to report#2.

8F)Insert YOUR name and address in the report #1 position.
   (Note; be sure to be accurate with the names and addresses)

9) Take the entire letter with the MODIFIED REPORT ORDERING LIST WITH
   YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS IN REPORT #1, and save to disk as well as your
   computer. Always back up the modified e-mail letter you will send
   as well as the reports you will receive in case you lose data.

10) The 5 reports you will receive will specifically explain in plain
   language how to effectively market your revised advertisement with
   you as the marketer of report #1. You will receive invaluable
   marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails, where
   to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. Your
   success results in our success and so on. We have info on bulk
   e-mailing companies as well as sending 1,000,000 e-mails for no
   charge. Several thousand free classified internet ad spaces you can
   use for no charge at the press of one keystroke. Additionally each
   marketer who will e-mail you a report usually messages to you what
   is working for him or her in terms of successful results. Again your
   success is our success and we hope you would adopt the same sort of
   caring for those who will respond to your marketing efforts. Their
   success will be your success too.

OK LETS TAKE A LOOK AND START ACTING ON YOUR DREAMS

The reports you will receive are specific and instructional and not vague novel-like essays that bore one to tears but does nothing for you. Bulk email companies that are large and professional are specifically highlighted as well as free internet classified add areas are also given. These reports actually read like a "cooking recipe". However instead of food.......you make MONEY.

Lets assume you decide to start small and take some baby steps to get started. Start initially with 10,000 emails and assume a conservative .001 (1 out of every 1000) response rate.)  Note convential direct marketing ie flyers and mailings average a .01 or 1 out of every 100 response rate and a closure of .005 or 1 out of every 200 left so the 1 out of 1000 e-mails IS conservative). Lets graph the results:

  TOTAL SENT     MARKETERS           PER REPORT           YOUR INCOME
1)      10,000          10            X $5.00       =    $       50.00
2)     100,000         100            X $5.00       =    $      500.00
3)   1,000,000       1,000            X $5.00       =    $    5,000.00
4)  10,000,000      10,000            X $5.00       =    $   50,000.00
5) 100,000,000     100,000            X $5.00       =    $  500,000.00
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   111,110,000     111,110     AND YOUR GRAND TOTAL IS>>>$  555,550.00
                               AND YOUR INITIAL EXPENSE>>$       25.00
                                                      -----------------
                               COULD YOU USE?????????????$  555,525.00

Remember the e-mails you will get and the companies you will get them from and who will actually send them for you are HIGH QUALITY. Not some
MOM AND POP SHOP that Jethro the inbred bucktoothed computer wiz (?) set up in the hen house. ALSO ONE OF THE REPORTS WILL EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW TO SEND 1 MILLION EMAILS AT NO CHARGE. These e-mail address are "opt-in" addresses or addresses that indicate they are open to receive unsolicited e-mail marketing campaigns. Also using another company to mail for you saves tremendous amounts of time and expense of doing it yourself. Dare to dream of the potential if you send 1 million e-mail ads or even 10 million. Remember you can start the program all over again after a few months of relaxing in the Bahamas sipping margueritas and enjoying life.

A WORD ON THE ELECTRONIC CLASSIFIED ADS YOU WILL PLACE ON THE INTERNET.

The second method highly recommended to support your marketing efforts is to place ads on some or all of the tens of thousands of electronic classified ad sites on the internet. It is very inexpensive and many of the add sites allow advertising for no charge at all. You will be provided with direct links to these sites in your 5 reports you order. You also will be provided with sites that will BLAST your add to thousands of free classified add sites. FOLKS THIS IS A GREAT TIMESAVER AS AT THE PRESS OF A SEND BUTTON, YOUR ADD WILL SOON MAKE ITS WAY TO THE THOUSAND OF FREE SITES. Our reports go into detail on the length and content of your add as well as catchy headliners THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO WORK. Remember your success is everyones success and therefore everyones success will be yours too by sharing with you what has already worked for others. Always ALWAYS provide same day service to your customers. When their $5.00 arrives e-mail to them immediately the report that was ordered from you. Also feel free t
message to them what is working for you in your efforts at that time. WHY? Because that person who just sent the $5.00 for the report is now WORKING FOR YOU TOO! Take care of your "employees" and they will take care of you.

PARENTS OF 15 YEAR OLD FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET

Do you recall seeing this headline about a year ago? This young mans mother was cleaning and putting away laundry when she came across a large paper grocery bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her boys closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash...five and tens and twenties and fifties and hundreds all neatly rubber banded in labled piles! "My first thought was that he robbed a bank" said the 41 year old mother. "There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag. More than what my husband could ever hope to make in a year at the car dealership". The woman immediately called her husband to tell what she discovered. He came home right away and they immediatley drove to the boys school and picked him up. Little did they suspect that "where" the money came from would be even more shocking than actually finding it in a bag in their sons closet.

As it turned out the boy had been sending out e-mail on the internet, a letter that he received recently via e-mail also. Every evening he would do this for a two month period after school in the evening on his computer in his bedroom. "I just got the e-mail one day and said what the heck. I sent five dollars to the five people for the reports, when they came I put my name on the list for report #1 and moved everyone down one spot and started sending out the add to others", said the clever 15 year old. "The reports I received for my 25.00 were fantastic. The e-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one $5.00 dollar bill to each of the 5 individuals. Those individuals would in turn e-mail me the 5 reports. I get junk e-mail all of the time and I really didnt think it was gonna work", the boy continued. Within the first few days of sending out the e-mail, the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines
...but envelopes containing $5.00 dollar bills with requests for the marketing reports. "About a week later I rode (my bike) down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelopes stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the (post office) counter. I thought I was in big trouble or something (laughs)". He goes on, "I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me". Over the next few weeks the boy continued to send out his advertisement on e-mail. "The money just kept comming in and I just kept sorting it out and stashing it in the closet. I barely had time to do my homework". He had also been riding his bike to several of the area banks and exchanging the fives for larger bills. "I didnt want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to the different banks with like $5,000 at a time in my backpack. I would tell the ladies at the counter that my dad had sent me in and was waiting for me outside".

Surprisingly the boy didnt have anything to fear at all! The investigative news reporting team found that this "letter" was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US Code, and also in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money receied. For every $5 dollar bill the young man received, he sent out the report that the customer requested via e-mail as advertised in his add. These reports and his actions constituted a legal transaction because he exchanged a service (report) for the $5 dollar that was tendered. The reports you will receive via e-mail and eventually send out via e-mail are the power behind the program. They include exclusive tips and information for cost effective promotion of those same reports. These reports are very comprehensive and to the point and will allow you to build and promote your business on the internet.

Oh.... buy the way...... The letter the 15 year old was marketing via e-mail is the same one you HAVE IN YOUR HAND. The reports he was selling are the same ones you will receive shortly when you elect to take action on your dreams. (what happened to those voices???? havent heard one in a while???? good riddance to them!!!!! listen to yourself from now on!!!!)

HERE IS THE LIST OF THE AVAILABLE REPORTS WITH THE RESPECTIVE MARKETERS NAME AND ADDRESS TO SEND YOUR $5 DOLLARS TO. (US CURRENCY ONLY).

Remember to order each report by name and number. Do not send check or credit card information. Conceal the cash with at least one sheet of paper to prevent any unscrupulous person from looking through the envelope. IT IS IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS YOU WANT THE REPORTS SENT TO AS THAT IS HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS. A sample order form for you to use:

Greetings
Please send via e-mail a copy of report #____ titled ___________________
____________________ to my e-mail at _________________@_________._____!
Please respond promptly as I am interested in pursuing our mutual goals!
Sincerely yours
_______________

Remember that once you send out the 5 envelopes each with $5.00 US dollars included, to remove the name and address on report #5, then slide everyone else down one report number. You will now have an empty name and address for report #1. You insert your name and address here on report #1. Then when you read all five reports you received for your $25.00 total purchase, you can begin your e-mail campaign and classifed advertisement barrage.

SOME SUCCESS GUIDELINES


If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do


After you have received 10 orders for Report #1, 2 to 3 weeks later you should receive 100 or more orders for Report #2. If you did not, continue to send out more e-mails until you do.


Once you have received 100 orders or more for Report #2 you can rest assured the program is working for you, and the income will soon start to generate for you. Remember those 100 will quite possibly send 1,000,000 e-mails each putting you as the seller for Report #3 on ..............ONE HUNDRED MILLION (100,000,000) EMAIL ADVERTISEMENTS.


Every time your name is moved down the list to a higher numbered report you are being placed on millions of more e-mail advertisements. You can keep track of the progress you are making just by seeing and noting what report is being ordered from you.


If you want to generate more income send another 1,000,000 e-mails and start the whole process again using the same ad letter (this one). There are no limits on when you can send additional e-mails. The more e-mails and the greater the frequency the better chance for success as you promote your business horizontally.


There is no need to track your results if you dont want to. Remember there are no employees ,no inventory, no office space, no postage, no headaches. Only the power of the computer, coupled with effective multilevel marketing strategies fueled by YOUR dreams. And ours too.


THIS NOTE IS FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THE MLM REPORT STRATEGIES


Hi
You have just received and read introductory information that can give you the financial freedom you have dreamed about. With NO RISK, a small investment of $25.00 in US funds only, and a little effort and lots of dreaming, you can generate more income than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY as instructed. Do not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well. Remember to e-mail a copy of this letter to thousands or millions of potential buyers only after you have inserted your name and address next to report #1 and move all of the marketeers down one report and removing the name and address on report #5. (he/she is probably on a cruise ship somewhere anyway). One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or 1 million or 5 million e-mails and your name will be on all of them for report #2. Remember though that the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach.


My friends, you have been given a spark to ignite your imagination. The reports will give you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independant...ITS UP TO YOU NOW.
Dream on.......,
Carol Abrahms


QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS THAT WE HAVE SEEN FROM TIME TO TIME.


Q: What should be my goal, having more people sign up to receive Report
  #1 from me or to have my name appear on Report #5.


A: Neither is exclusive of the other. The more people you sign up
  initially will result on your appearing eventually on a much greater
  number (hundreds of millions) of e-mail ads that will have you on
  #5. Build your business horizontally by e-mailing millions and the
  vertical aspect will take care of itself. If you look at the example
  where you start out at just 10,000 emails and look at the step 3 with
  1,000,000 e-mails. Suppose you START out with 1,000,000 e-mails in
  step (report) #1. It would be the same as having 7 levels to
  participate in instead of just 5. That is because you built a more
  horizontal structure with your initial e-mailing campaign. If you
  start at 1,000,000, by the time your name and address reach Report
  #5, you could conceivably be on billions of e-mails from other
  marketers instead of just 100,000,000. Do you see now the value of
  "comming out of the gate" strong?



Q: Why not just put all of my family names on each report 1-5 so that
  all of the money for all of the reports comes to us?


A: It defeats the tremendous income generating potential of the program.
  Here is why. Suppose your e-mail efforts generate 100 responses.
  This would result in your "family" making $500 dollars each or a
  total of $2,500 dollars. WOW you say. But here is where you lose
  out. The 100 new marketers will now bump off your family member that
  was wrongly inserted in Report #5. So $500.00 is it for that person.
  A better way is to have your "family" members in your horizontal
  structure to give them a chance to earn thousand of dollars. Instead
  of 100 people you would have 104 folks responding. That last person
  you wrongly put on Report #5 now has the opportunity to earn over
  $500,000 for your "family" as opposed to being limited to just the
  $500. Additionally your family member put on Report #4 will have only
  made about $5000 as he or she gets only two shots (Reports #4 and #5)
  to stay in the program. Another opportunity lost. In fact the only
  person who will realize the full potential of the program would be
  the person you put in report #1. The rest lose out significantly.



Q: I am able to accept checks and credit cards in my current business
  activities. Why can I not do it with this program?


A: As you can see, this program has been streamlined for ease of entry
  and understanding by and for everyone. Since this letter will be used
  AS IS WITH NO MODIFICATIONS, we must consider those who for whatever
  reason, may not have the capacity to accept what you are able to.
  Also there is also the potential problem of bounced checks, credit
  card cancellations and fraud. Additionally the credit card fees that
  can be charged are borderline extortion. Lets not forget that alot of
  businesses also put a hold for up to two weeks on checks which
  would result in not receiving the reports for that hold period.
  It just adds too much drag to a streamlined program. Do you think
  our 15 year old boy above would have been able to achieve his success
  had he been burdened with credit card acceptance and check clearing
  procedures? Remember too that others were relying on his efforts to
  sell their reports. That income for all would not have been realized
  had he been required to accept credit cards and checks. The loss to
  ALL participants would be enormous, and well beyond just the
  $71,000 plus our 15 year old wonder kid made.



Q: If I have problems whom can I contact?


A: When you receive your reports you will receive a short message from
  the person who sends it to you. You can contact them as their success
  depends on your success. Also the reports contain addresses of clubs
  devoted to MLM and bulk e-mailing and add placing. The chat boards
  are full of decent people who will answer your questions.



Q: I see other e-mail adds that basically say MLM advertising and money
  making strategies are to be avoided, and to sign on with their
  program instead.


A: Lets make it a habit to not criticize other money making
  opportunities. However we can do a little education. Most who make
  those comments in their adds are on the top of their pyramid and are
  banking on YOUR efforts to build THEIR empires. There are no
  opportunities to ever have your income level increase above those
  who are at the top of that ladder. Its no different than your current
  job right? YOU work and THEY profit. Our program offers the
  opportunity to make more money than those who initially contacted
  you. Also after 5 steps down the report list, the person who got you
  started drops out of the game and can re-enter but at the report
  level #1. Remember the people making these claims will always remain
  above you, effectively quashing any chance for REAL FINANCIAL GAINS!
  With our program you will be selling all of the reports (all levels).
  We are all equal in this endeavor but the income levels you can
  achieve are not limited by those skimming your earnings from on top
  of you as really no one is on top of you. For example the person in
  Report #5 will be bumped off of the modified letter you will send
  (and fall on a nicely padded wallet I might add). He or she is free
  to re-enter the program again starting on Report #1. This is opposed
  to other programs where those on the top stay there for ever and skim
  your hard earnings too.



Q: This program is beginning to gain incredible popularity with the
  international community. Why limit the program to accepting
  US currency only?


A: The US dollar is the most widely accepted and traded currency on the
  planet. Though the program is gaining international momentum, the
  inherent complexities for the average citizen to manage some sort
  of currency exchange is extremely difficult. It is incumbant upon
  the person who wants to enter the program to convert his or her
  currency into US dollars and then send the US dollars to pay for the
  reports. Moreover the complexities of currency exchange
  responsibilities would make this streamlined program too difficult
  to manage for motivated people like our 15 year old boy. The beauty
  of the program is in its simplicity. US dollars are also required
  for transactions between marketers who are residents of countries
  other than the United States ie a transaction between a resident of
  Mexico and one from Canada. It is also required of transactions that
  occur in the SAME international country ie Australia to Australia.
  It is a very simple process to go to the bank and convert your
  currency to US dollars. Remember YOU ONLY HAVE TO DO THIS ONE TIME
  AS ONLY A $25.00 DOLLAR INVESTMENT IS REQUIRED. A small inconvenience
  for huge potential income. Remember "25.00 cash US currency only" is
  a lot easier to remember than incredibly complex currency exchanges
  and credit card and check cashing procedures don't you agree?



Q: I have seen a very similar program being offered but instead you only
  have to buy 4 total reports for $20.00. Why should I use this program
  instead of the 4 report one being offered and save $5.00?


A: Your answer is that both programs are really one in the same. But
  remember how we asked to "follow directions specifically and to not
  make any changes?" Unfortunately one person absentmindedly mistook
  the directions to remove the person in Report #5 and REMOVED THE
  ENTIRE REPORT #5 LEVEL ITSELF!!!! Good Grief. This is the level that
  makes the most money for you. Now there is a mangled clone out there
  that is limiting those participants total incomes. Remember that when
  you get your name up to report #5, you are appearing on possibly
  hundreds of MILLIONS of e-mail advertisements. We are attempting at
  every opportunity to educate those who unknowingly enter the program
  using only the 4 report mistake. It will take time but we dont see it
  very often anymore. Can you think for one moment how that extra $5.00
  and extra report #5, and appearing on hundreds of millions of e-mail
  ads on level 5 will benefit you? This is a good exercise to see the
  value of this program as well as to reinforce the phrase of "follow
  the directions exactly as written and make no changes to the e-mail
  you have received that you will send out other than adding yourself
  to report #1 and sliding everyone down one report level. The person
  who currently appears on report #5 should be removed completely BUT
  DO NOT ELIMINATE REPORT #5!!!" One more thing is to NOT ADD ANY MORE
  REPORTS OR LEVELS BEYOND REPORT #5. This detracts from this fine
  program by causing confusion. Also it forces direct marketers to
  subsequently re-enter the program on Report #1 therefore allowing
  lower levels to move up more quickly. This differentiates this
  program from other MLM programs that have 7 or 10 or 20 levels. And
  further differentiates the program from those non MLM programs whose
  founders constantly criticize the MLM strategies.

I was a recently furloughed Airline Pilot who while saving a good bit of money, was shocked at being out of the door and out of work. I was saving this e-mail message I received a few months back and finally decided to act on it. The program is working as advertised and I expect to double my salary that I would have received had I still been employed at the airlines. I expect to be called back within two years but will continue this program indefinitely. I'm definitely impressed.

My name is Mitchell. My wife Jody and I live in Chicago, Il. I am a cost accountant with a major US corporation and I make good money. When I received the program I grumbled to Jody about receiving "junk mail". I made fun of the whole thing, spouting off my knowledge of population and percentages involved. I "knew" it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing didn't work.....Well the laugh was on me! Within two weeks she had received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5.00 bills! I was shocked! I was sure that I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work. I AM a believer now. I have joined Jody in her "hobby". I did have seven more years until retirement, but I think of the "rat race" and it's not for me. We owe it to MLM.

My husband was working more hours per week to offset the paycuts he needed to take in order to maintain his managerial position. He's such a sweet guy who never complained but I could see in his eyes the frustration and fatigue he was experiencing. I also felt guilt that I was unable to work as our three children were not of sufficient age to attend school and daycare would be more expensive than any income I could make to offset it. This MLM program allowed the both of us to work at home between diapers and feedings. My husband has since left his job and he and I now have a substantial income. But more important we now have alot more time together and with our kids who we now home school.

The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest, lawful, and extremely profitable. I was e-mailed on several occassions before I decided to act. I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal amount of effort and money required to start. To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks, with money still comming in.

I was a survivor of a horrible traffic accident that led to alot of unpaid bills and the loss of my ability to work. This program has given me back my self esteem in that I CAN make money and be productive while confined to a wheelchair. So far I have seen 81,000 dollars in five dollar bills in the past 12 months. And I have only e-mailed around 1 million addresses so far. I am on report 3 and expect to see alot more money in the next year as my name will appear on reports 4 and 5. This program is for everyone, young, old, rich, poor, man, woman, black, white, healthy or handicap. God bless.

Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way I wasn't going to get enough orders to get my money back. Boy, was I surprised when I found my medium sized post office box crammed with orders! For awhile it got so overloaded that I had to start picking mail up at the window. I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before. The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster rate of return.

I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another program.....11 months passed and then it came.....I didn't delete this one!.....I made more than $41,000 on the first try.

This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off of the interest on our money. The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it. For your sake and for your families sake, don't pass up this golden opportunity. Good luck and happy spending.
