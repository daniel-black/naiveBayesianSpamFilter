I have been on the Internet for 5 years doing bulk e-mail.  I know one thing for sure about it.  IT REALLY WORKS!  For the first time we are offing to sell out list.  These names are clean of duplicates and have just been updated.  Do not be fooled by the others selling 100 million for so much They are played out.

We are selling a data base of  20 million for $110.00.  I will even include a short guide on how to mail out.
