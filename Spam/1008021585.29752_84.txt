<h2>2000 Year Old Bread Recipe Actually Helps You Lose Weight!</h2>
<p>THIS IS A ONE TIME MAILING.</p>
<p>HUNZA DIET BREAD is a bread That Miraculously Stops Your Appetite And Hunger
and is based on a 2000 year old recipe said to beat all fad diets hands down.
It's the fastest, and totally painless way to lose weight.</p>
<p>By Mary Travis,<br>
Special feature writer<br>
(Canfield, OH)
<p>Is there a painless way for people to lose weight? Yes! HUNZA DIET BREAD is
being hailed as the weight loss method of the century. The bread is a duplicate
of a 2,000-year-old recipe used by the little known civilization of Hunza.
<p>The Hunzas are considered to be the healthiest people on earth. Their bread
is the main part of their diet. This bread is absolutely delicious. Everybody
loves it. But then a startling discovery was made. Just one or two slices of
this bread would suppress a person's appetite for 4 to 6 hours! Could this be a
designed bread invented thousands of years ago?
<p>There are facts being uncovered that support a theory that this bread was
designed in ancient times for the express purpose of tiding people over when
food supplies were scarce. Let's start with the Hunzas who are exceptionally
trim, fit and the healthiest people on earth. Many consider their bread to be
one of the main reasons for the extraordinary health of the Hunzas.
<p>Here is a little background of the Hunzas from a feature story which has been
published in many major newspapers throughout North America. This is an excerpt
from the article:
<p>&quot;The Hunzas exist isolated from the rest of the world in the Himalayan
Mountains where they live to be 110 to 120 years of age. They have no cancer,
heart attacks or other major disorders to speak of. They are active and fit to
the end of their lives. Men father children at 100 years of age and older.
Overweight people are unheard of because they have the perfect weight control
system.&quot;
<p>The story then relates research and fact finding visits to Hunza by such
notables as Queen Elizabeth, Art Linkletter, N.B.C., The National Geographic
Magazine, Frank Shor, Lowell Thomas Jr. and Chou En Lai of China. Visitors to
Hunza all came back with the same identical description of the Hunza people:
<p>&quot;Hunza men are straight, tall, broad-shouldered, deep-chested, slim-
waisted, heavy-legged and have full heads of hair. Hunza women are straight,
tall, slim-waisted, developed bosoms, perfect complexions and luxuriant hair.
Both men and women have perfect teeth and eyesight even at 100 years of age and
older! They are neat, clean, intelligent and friendly and you can't find an
overweight person.
<p>Hunza women at 80 look no older than North American women of 40. Fatigue is
virtually unknown. Hunza men over 90 years old repeatedly walk the mountain
trail of 65 miles from the town of Gilgit with a full pack and immediately start
to work in the fields again!&quot;
<p>We feel that the Hunza bread may be &quot;by design&quot; both a hunger
suppressant and a super health food. It is a simple, nutritious bread that is
easily prepared in just 5 minutes using a few ingredients that have always been
universally available and the taste is wonderful.
<p>The Hunzas were originally soldiers of Alexander the Great. This bread may
have been designed for the use of his far traveling armies. It would make sense.
It's the most compact form of hunger satisfaction and nutrition we know of.
According to traces of Macedonian Heritage, this bread could have originated in
Egypt over 5,000 years ago. As you know, the Egyptians were capable of doing
many things that modern science cannot, even today, duplicate.
<p>We are convinced that the Hunza bread is one of the major reasons for the
good health of the Hunzas.
<p>Both my husband and I started using the bread as a weight loss device and
began losing weight consistently, much faster than any weight loss method we
ever tried, and, we have tried them all believe me. Exactly how does the HUNZA
DIET BREAD compare to some of the fad diets such as liquid protein?
<p>There's no comparison. Fad diets are not only ineffective, they may be
downright dangerous. When I say they are ineffective I mean; that either a
person will not stick with them because they are uncomfortable or when the diet
is over they'll put the weight right back on. Because bread is part of our
culture this diet is never over. HUNZA DIET BREAD becomes our bread substitute
not only because it helps control our weight but because it is so delicious and
easy to prepare.
<p>All of us lifetime dieters know of the miseries of the high protein and
liquid protein (or milkshake) diets. They seem okay for the first few days, then
they become repulsive. You get &quot;full&quot; on these diets but not
satisfied. Let me tell you about the advantages of HUNZA DIET BREAD. The biggest
benefit I can think of is that the dieter just doesn't suffer AT ALL! It's such
a natural and powerful appetite inhibitor. This bread is not only healthful and
delicious but you will appreciate its simplicity and lack of extraneous
ingredients.
<p>This bread satisfies both appetite and hunger. And it does it with only 100
calories as effectively as most 1800 calorie full meals.
<p>We define appetite and hunger like this: appetite is mainly the desire you
get for food even when you know you're really not hungry. It's that craving in
your mouth you get that's known as the cold mouth feeling. It can also be
present even though you've just eaten. Your stomach may be full but you still
crave something else. This is the feeling you get with a protein diet. You can
stuff yourself with protein until you're ready to burst but the cold mouth
craving is still there.
<p>Hunger on the other hand is best described as those pangs of hunger you get
or that empty feeling in your stomach that lets you know you really need to eat
something rather than simply wanting to eat for the enjoyment of it.
<p>After a slice or two of HUNZA DIET BREAD you eliminate both appetite and
hunger. You feel satisfied and full and it lasts, depending on the person, up to
7 hours. For me it lasts 5 to 7 hours.
<p>Not only is the bread nutritional, but it contains some proven good health
producing roughage or fiber. It passes through your digestive system quickly so
the actual absorbed calories are less. You also become very regular eating this
bread and it tastes better than any bread that we've ever eaten.
<p>Now, here's what its like hour by hour after you eat the bread.
<p>Hour 1 and 2. Each minute after you finish eating the bread seems like a
build-up of a &quot;fullness&quot; feeling. It's just as though you have kept on
eating. You keep getting fuller and fuller. Both your appetite and hunger are
very satisfied. You don't crave anything more.
<p>Hour 3. In hour 3 something else happens. The thought of food just doesn't
appeal to you. It's not an unpleasant experience, quite the opposite. But, you
don't have a desire for food in any way, shape or form.
<p>Hour 4. You no longer have a feeling of being stuffed or turned off by the
thought of eating, but there's a kind of nothing feeling. You don't want to eat,
and you don't crave anything. It's just as I said, a sort of comfortable
&quot;nothing&quot; stage.
<p>Hour 5 through 7. Toward the end of the 5th hour you begin to get mildly
hungry which then slowly increases into the 6th and 7th hour.
<p>All of this for only the cost of 100 to 200 calories .You can't get that
performance out of an 1800 calorie meal.
<p>Here's another little known thing about standard lunch hours and dinners.
Let's say you eat a milk shake, hamburger and french fries for lunch. That's
over a 1,000 calories. There's a lot of sugar and salt in that meal. When you're
done the first thing that happens is that your body shoots a large amount of
insulin into your system to counteract the sugar. The insulin lowers your blood
sugar and within an hour you feel hungry again and start snacking. On top of
that the salt has made you thirsty and you gulp water or soft drinks and retain
the fluids.
<p>On the other hand, if you try a weight watchers lunch, or similar balanced
diet, you'd have to eat between 400 to 600 calories of cottage cheese, lean
meat, and eggs to feel reasonably full, but you would not be satisfied and
almost immediately you'd be hungry again and need to consume more of the same.
You can't win.
<p>You will feel better and look better after you start eating this bread. When
you take a bite of the HUNZA DIET BREAD the delicious taste of the bread fills
your mouth. You can tell that it is hearty, full of substance, chewy and good
for you. Perhaps our bodies trigger an instinct that lets us know what's good or
bad for us.
<p>HUNZA DIET BREAD is indeed the best bread I have ever tasted. The bread is
out of this world. It just gives you what you crave. We decided to simply
publish the recipe for anyone who'd like to make it at home. The amazing thing
is that it only takes 5 minutes to prepare. I am sure you will love both the
