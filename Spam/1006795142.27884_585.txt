             A great idea in Network Marketing !
          ****************************************
I've just discovered an Irish telecommunications company that has launched "PC to Phone" (PC to PC, webcam, fax & lots more products) into the market.. 
This company exists 17 years already as a Telecommunications research company so are well established and know what they are doing.
They decided to sell there exclusive high-tech system through the Network Marketing concept. (good news for us internet MLM fans)
This means anyone can phone from there PC (with a simple microphone) to any fixed or cellular phone number in the world, only paying your local internet communications costs.
And by sharing this product with friends, associates & family, you will be paid very generous commissions 10 generations deep.
This is a PRE LAUNCH! but you can sign in & start building an organisation without paying the inscription fee until  the first of January 2002 ! afterwards you have 7 days in which to pay your one time inscription fee of  168.95 $ ( you receive commissions on all entries 10 levels deep) there is a monthly subscription cost (19.95 $) which also pays out commissions (4.5%)10 levels deep.
This is a great tool for other MLM companies to approach there new international prospects & to create conference cafes to communicate & motivate there downline. 
I cannot send a direct link to my site with this mail without a positive enquiry from your part to this mail, so if you want to know more please return this mail with your questions (please put “I would like to know more” in the subject box). I will be happy to contact you immediatly.
If I have intruded your privacy in any way! I truly apologise ! please send by return mail with “remove” as subject! I will never bother you again.
