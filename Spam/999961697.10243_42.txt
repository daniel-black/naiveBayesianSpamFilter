                    <p>Amateur and professional golfers a=
like all have trouble
                      with Mother Nature. There are no ex=
ceptions to this rule.
                      The trick is to learn how to turn t=
he effects of organic
                      conditions into an aid. </p>
                    <p>Typically the greatest natural wea=
ther deterrent to a
golfer
                      is wind. Rain, snow and hail certai=
nly can affect ball
flight
                      but none are played in as regularl=
y as a cool zephyr, so
                      for the purposes of our reader bas=
e we will be
restricting
                      our efforts to the aforementioned. </p>
                    <p>For the most part golfers in coas=
tal areas are more
adept
                      at playing in stiff, breezy weathe=
r, but even those in
Tennessee
                      Valley should be learning how to a=
ccount for the
bedeviling
                      effect of this cruel handicap. </p>
                    <p>Here are some keys to playing in t=
he wind that should
help
                      to keep your scorecard in double di=
gits and closer to
par:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li> Club selection - When playing i=
nto a headwind, for
                        every five miles per hour the wind a=
ppears to be
blowing
                        choose one more club. Use the opposite
philosophy for
                        hitting with the wind, but DO NOT trick yourself
into
                        believing the wind can help you carry the ball
250
yards
                        with a four iron.</li>
                      <li>Swing plane - Unless you are a single digit
handicapper,
                        do not swing any differently than you normally
would.
                        If you are an accomplished player, then be sure
to
always
                        take a simple ¾ swing to avoid getting too much
                        air under that ball. </li>
                      <li>Look for Tree Tops - Although the wind may
appear to
                        be blowing into your face, it does not
necessarily mean
                        that it will be doing the same thing 50 feet in
the
air.
                        Look at the tops of nearby trees to indicate
what
direction
                        the wind is actually blowing.</li>
                      <li>Balls - Choose a lower spinning ball when
playing in
                        the wind. The new line of low trajectory,
low-spinning
                        golf balls perform better in the wind then high
spinning,
                        accuracy balls. </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The wind can become your friend if you let it.
Simply
account
                      for the wind by knowing where it is, how much it
is
blowing
                      and how well you trust your judgment. </p>
                    <p>And for the record, if you find yourself
desperate for
                      advice on snow, lighting or hail...seek help
immediately
                      at your local 12 step program for golfers

because
                      you have it bad!</p>

                    <p><b>Readers Choice </b></p>
                    <p>The collective voice of The Golf Ledger faithful
has
spoken.
                      In the last issue we concerned ourselves with
finding out
                      how you, our readers, felt about the Captain's
Picks
                      for the Ryder Cup Team. </p>
                    <p>Although our resident columnist still holds a
fascist
point
                      of view on this subject, it appears that y'all
like the
                      way things worked out. </p>
                    <p>Here are a just a couple of comments from our
readers:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>"Leave them alone. That's why they are
called
                        the captain's picks." <br>
                        W. Duncan. </p>
                      <p>"...consider Paul Azinger, a great golfer who
                        fought and conquered cancer. Consider too Scott
Verplank,
                        a great golfer who continually copes with adult
diabetes
                        through an insulin pump that sits on the back of
his
trousers.
                        Are Paul Azinger and Scott Verplank apt to
infuse their
                        team with the sort of cosmic glue which led Ben
Crenshaw
                        to make a prediction that seemed all too
out-of-touch
                        with reality? YOU BET THEY ARE! Now, in the
words of
Captain
                        Curtis Strange, 'let's kick their a--!'"
                        <br>
                        B.B. </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>These sentiments are hard to ignore! We are
hoping for
                      a cleaner match this year than the stained imprint
left
                      by so many cleats pounding over Olazabal's line
two
                      years ago. That was ugly! </p>
                    <p>Good luck to our men at the Belfry, and more
importantly,
                      as this is a gentlemen's game above all else, good

                      luck to all the participants. We can only pray
that this
                      year's Cup will be half as exciting as the last!

                    <p><b>Rah rah friggin rah!</b> </p>
                    <p>Every two years we all wax patriotic in the game
of golf
                      for some brief sense of solidarity about how proud
we are
                      to be American Golfers. Yeah!</p>
                    <p>Why should we not? We are proud American's,
aren't
                      we? It means something to actually bond with other

competitors
                      in the spirit of righteous indignation to the
Europeans.
                      Doesn't it? </p>
                    <p>Let us contemplate this for a moment. When we
watch the
                      Master's, do we really root against anyone making
a
                      putt? More than likely we have an ambiguous sense
of
obligation
                      to chivalry, and we keep our feelings locked
inside, even
                      though our favorite golfer may not win as a result
of his
                      opponent heroically draining that 10 footer. So we
are
faced
                      with the eternal question once again. </p>
                    <p>Is how we root for the Ryder Cup the truth in how
we
feel
                      about golf, or is it just a phony neanderlithic
attempt
                      at team unity? </p>
                    <p>My guess? We all need to come clean. We really
want our
                      favorites to win all the time, and we all have a
couple
                      people we like to watch lose. Sorry Colin. The
dignity of
                      the game need not be compromised, of course. It's
not
                      like we will be hearing, in union, a crowd yell
"Noonan"
                      or "Miss it." But the time has come to drop our
                      hypocritical sense of devotion to gamesmanship.
</p>
                    <p>Gamesmanship is about being honest on the field
of play,
                      and adhering to the rules as they have been
established.
                      It is not for not having an opinion about who
                      you would like to see win. </p>
                    <p>So for all you wisea#$ football and hockey fans
out
there,
                      here is your personal invitation to become a part
of the
                      new era. When in the privacy of one's own home, or

                      at you're favorite watering hole, don't be
afraid
                      to cut loose with a hooray when Mickelson misses
his next
                      chance to win a major. If he is not your guy, who
cares!
                    </p>
                    <p>Be sure however to keep your cheering to a low
roar as
                      you never know if a golf brawl might break out. I
mean,
                      who hasn't seen those infamous fringe clearing
brawls
                      that have become famous the past few years? Those
are
