My business is 4 blocks from ground zero and I lost 3 friends in that horrific tragedy of 11 September.

I decided to do something to help our cause. So, I found a company that makes high quality American Flags and a Florida company to send out this email to you to make you this offer:

Beautiful 3 foot by 5 foot American Flag made of durable thick nylon with fade resistant colors and brass grommets. Perfect for years of enjoyment for home, office or yard.

Suggested retail price is $29.95 order now New York Special just $12.95 plus $6 shipping and handling.

I'm so confident that you will be happy with the quality of your American Flag that if for any reason you are dissatisfied (in the first 30 days) I will refund your full purchase price no questions asked. 

Call now 1-877-810-5562 we accept Visa, Master Card, American Express and Discover.

 Or send a check or money order to: Interlink
						39 Broadway
						Suite 520
						New York, New York 10006


Thank You and God Bless America!
