    markets. <b>ETPI</b> is an exclusive supplier of entertainment services on 
    U.S. military 
    bases worldwide and has been awarded an Armed Forces Non-Appropriated Funds

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The 
    stock is essentially near its all-time low when it should be near it's all-time

    and non-cash flow to positive cash flow and positive earnings per share.</font></p>

    standpoint, the stock is currently the most attractive an investment that 
    its been in the six years they've been public</b>. The return to profitability, 
    and the budget release, should provide the explosion to propel the stock to 
    many times its current level.   <b>Don't miss this outstanding opportunity!</b></font></p>
