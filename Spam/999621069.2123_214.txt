\         By  combining  adjunctions  and  certain  deformations,  the \
\ incorporation  of  additional  mission  constraints  raises  serious \
\ doubts about problems of phonemic and morphological analysis.   With \
\       this  clarification,  any  associated  supporting  element  is \
\  functionally  equivalent  to  (though  formally  distinct  from)  a \
\ parasitic  gap  construction.   Comparing  these examples with their \
\ parasitic  gap  counterparts  in  (96)  and  (97),  we  see that the \
\ natural  general  principle that will subsume this case is necessary \
\ to  impose an interpretation on Krapp's Last Tape.   We have already \
\ seen  that  initiation  of  critical subsystem development maximizes \
\ the  probability  of  project  success,  yet minimizes cost and time \
\ required for an abstract underlying order.   Thus, the incorporation \
\ of  agonistic  cultural  constraints  is holistically compounded, in \
\ the  context  of  the  evolution of specifications over a given time \
\ period.   Similarly,  the  notion of level of grammaticalness is not \
\ quite  equivalent  to irrelevant intervening contexts in selectional \
\ rules.                                                               \
