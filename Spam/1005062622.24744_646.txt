SUBJECT: 2nd Chance To Make NEW 4 Team *Read ALL*
Content-Length: 1554

I sent this message out 2 weeks ago and had 4 people selected within  4 hours of emailing it out....Now I have 2 of my top producers that each will do the same...this is a 2nd chance for you to take advantage of the below offer.

(This message was sent out Oct 27)
Seeking 4 people who will devote time to  learning how to email market online (If you pass my phone interview , I will pay for your course and software and will also  provide these 4 people with over 1 million email addresses to start) .  I know this sounds to good to be true but visit the site below and complete all three steps.   I am in the top 5% of network marketer's (this IS MLM!)  and am testing a new online method of building a business (No family/freinds-TOTAL Internet Selling/Prospecting).   If you read all three pages and complete the form, I will contact you personaly and give you some additional details.  You will not be wasting your time. I will select 4 people by Monday evening..the date is November 6 ,2001. **No Hype...Promise**** You will THANK ME****
