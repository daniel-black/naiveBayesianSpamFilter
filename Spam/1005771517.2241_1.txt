Dear burton@bfsmedia.com,

Stop paying inflated prices for the medications you need!

Order a 1 year subscription to our Online Pharmacy Guide today for only $19.95! We provide you with everything you need to know to mail order discount medications from foreign and domestic pharmacies online.

Tens of thousands of medications are available, often without a prescription or upon review by a network physician with an online consultation.  These are the same popular medications you can buy in the U.S. for weight management, hair loss, smoking cessation, pain relief, depression, impotence, HIV/AIDS, fitness and bodybuilding, even anti-aging protocols and hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

The Online Pharmacy Guide contains hundreds of sources including URL's, email addresses, phone/fax numbers, and even mailing addresses to direct you where to purchase meds online. Listings also include known medications and other products carried by each of the sources and other details we've turned up during our research. 

Visit us at http://151.202.19.209:8080 to learn more about this incredible offer!

Only $19.95 for a 1 year subscription -- order yours today!
