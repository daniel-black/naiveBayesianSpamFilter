Dear sir/madam,

The Dot Com era may be over, but an exciting new era on the Internet has just quietly begun, as the stock markets and technology sector begin turning around. On October 01, 2001 a new top-level domain name extension called Dot Info was officially launched. As a member of the Internet community, you should secure your Dot Info domain name as soon as possible to avoid disappointment as there will be tremendous rush from the general public once the word gets out.

NewTLDRegistry.net has now begun accepting registrations for the .INFO and other upcoming new domain extensions. This means that you can now register an attractive new domain name of your choice that is short and easy to remember. If you missed out on .COM, here is your chance with .INFO. If do not act as soon as possible, you may unfortunately miss out on the biggest cyberspace land grab in the history of the Internet. The time to act is now. Visit: http://www.NewTLDRegistry.net to register now.

Over 400,000 .INFO names have already been registered by savvy consumers; however, there are a lot more good names available. Just try a search and see for yourself. Over 3 million domain names are expected to be registered over the next two months. An exciting new era is about to unfold on the Internet. Go to http://www.NewTLDRegistry.net to register now.
