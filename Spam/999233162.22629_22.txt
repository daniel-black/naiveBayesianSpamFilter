<b>Let's face it.<br><br></b> Today's market has left investors chewing on their fingernails in fear. But you could be one of the lucky ones...the champion investor who everybody envies: we'll let you in on a little secret, which will make you a very substantial profit: 

<P align=center style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;FONT-SIZE:13px">
<b>The X-change Corporation [XCHC], traded on the OTCBB.</b>

<P align=justify style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;FONT-SIZE:12px">The X-change Corporation is developing an <b>alternative trading system</b> which finally makes it possible for more than 5600 Pink-Sheets companies to be traded fully automated instead of by telephone! 

<P align=justify style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;FONT-SIZE:12px">
Currently, these Pink-Sheerts are virtually impossible to trade because there is no central order book and no central order routing. <b>Due to the X-change, this will all suddenly change, making it possible for thousands of US companies to be traded easily from all over the world</b>, expanding their liquidity and significantly increasing their value. 
So the X-change is in fact an emerging stock exchange, like the Nasdaq and the OTCBB were a long time ago! 

<P align=justify style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;FONT-SIZE:12px">
In our opinion, this represents a tremendous investment opportunity since there is a very high demand for such an automated trading system. And there is no competition: The X-change is the only company developing a solution, making it a very safe investment. <b>At $0.70 you would not be buying a stock, you would be buying a stock exchange!</b> This company is extremely undervalued and based on EPS projections a price target of $6.00 can be reached in the near future.

<LI><b>Revolution:</b>
<UL>
<LI>XCHC revitalises an antiquated trading system: their proprietary software is designed as an alternative trading system for low liquidity securities. 
<LI>XCHC has formed strategic alliances with industry leaders in the field of online transaction processing.

<LI><b>Investor Awareness:</b>
<UL>
<LI>XCHC is not yet known to the general public since it started trading only a few weeks ago. But this should soon change when the investor community discovers the underlying potential. 
<LI>The X-change is only trading at $0.65, which ensures a very high upward potential.

<LI><b>Revenues:</b>
<UL style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;FONT-SIZE:12px">

In our opinion, the X-change is ready to start moving up with little attention from the investor community. Any significant news release could trigger this reaction.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD bgcolor=white><br>

<P align=justify style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;FONT-SIZE:12px">
The X-Change is the developer of an alternative trading system for securities otherwise excluded from conventional trading venues. Pink Sheet issues, traded through the National Quotation Bureau, are the company's primary focus, but the system will also handle other Bulletin Board stocks, American Depository Receipts, private placement issues, and shares issued under SEC Rule 144. 
<P align=justify style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;FONT-SIZE:12px">
These securities issues are often sold at significantly lower prices than real value due to the absence of an efficient market mechanism. The X-Change will offer a method of transaction that will serve this poorly addressed market and act as a platform for investing in young, emerging companies.. 
<P align=justify style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;FONT-SIZE:12px">
The X-Change's alternative trading system will provide market transparency, realtime quotes and trade reporting and live data feeds to the National Quotation Bureau and third party data vendors. The system receives securities orders via the Internet or a private network, performs price discovery and delivers orders to multiple execution destinations. The system then feeds back transaction confirmation to the order source. 
<P align=justify style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;FONT-SIZE:12px">
The system will allow investors at all levels to make investment decisions, based on reliable market and pricing information that was previously unavailable.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD bgcolor=white><br>

<P align=justify style="FONT-FAMILY:Arial;FONT-SIZE:12px">
The X-Change is a company with a proprietary trading system, entering a market that is in high demand for the service they provide. By providing a transparant trading system for Pink Sheet issues, these will become more attractive to the investment community. This will generate a continuous flow of new users for The X-Change.
