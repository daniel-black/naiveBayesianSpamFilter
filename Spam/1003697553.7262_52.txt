Dear Internet User,

Have you heard the latest news on .INFO? It's finally launched and official!  The wait is finally over.  As the owner of an existing domain, it's important for you to secure the rights to the .INFO equivalent of your domain name immediately.  According to Afilias, the registry operator for the .INFO extension, more than 400,000 names have been successfully registered so far and thousands are are being taken each day by customers like you.  It's very important to maintain your online identity and prevent confusion, so register your .INFO today at: http://www.NewExtensionCentral.com

The .INFO extension works the same way as .COM/NET/ORG. Basically, once you register the domain, you will have access to a Domain Control Panel which you can use to manage the domain name. You can use it for a new email address or to redirect traffic to your existing domain name. As a matter of fact, many customers are now registering names just to keep them from falling into the hands of unscrupulous speculators and cybersquatters. Check if your domain is still available at: http://www.NewExtensionCentral.com

Sincerely,

Rebecca
