Dear Friend:

We have all been touched one way or another by the tragic events that
occured on September 11, 2001.

The "Memorial Flag" is an amazing memorial to those events that occured,
as well as a way to help.

When viewed from a distance, it is our great American Flag. When viewed up
close, you will notice it is made up of close to 1,000 crystal clear micro-
image photos of the events from September 11, 2001. You may view this
incredible poster print by visiting www.memorialflag.com

This print is beginning to acquire national attention. It has been
featured on many news and TV shows including The Today Show; Has been
heard on several radio stations, as well as featured in many newspapers.
The White House has even inquired on placing a "large" order.  This is
quickly becoming the "pinnacle" memorial to these tragic, yet history
making events.

This incredible print is a benefit for The Fallen Firefighters Fund in New
York. Many people are ordering multiples of this item to give as gifts for
Christmas. Please take a moment to check out the website, and don't
hesitate to call with any questions.

Thank you for your support.
