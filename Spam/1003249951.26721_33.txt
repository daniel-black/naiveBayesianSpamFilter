My unprofessional little home made web site brought in $115,467.21 last year and you're about to discover how you can do the same...

" How To Get FIVE Money-Making Web Sites In 29 Minutes Or Less...                                                                                  
                Without  Spending  A Fortune!"

Dear Fellow Entreprenuer:

You're about to discover how you can have FIVE of your own Internet businesses set up and taking orders within 29 minutes...for less than half of what most people spend on groceries!

But first, please let me introduce myself...

Hi! My name is Sheri Andrews. I'd like for you to know up front that I'm not an Internet Guru...Not A Computer Wiz...And Not A Marketing Genius.  I'm a single mom trying to make life a little easier for me and my family.

First of all, I'll admit that I don't expect you to believe a single word I say.

After all, how many times a day are you BOMBARDED with some lame "get-rich-quick" scheme on the Internet?

You probably get a brand new promise of instant wealth every few hours in your e-mail box and if you're anything like me, you've tried a few and been left with nothing but a hole in your pocket!

Well, I've got great news for you.

Now you too can make great money right from your home with your own auto-pilot "Internet Empire"!
