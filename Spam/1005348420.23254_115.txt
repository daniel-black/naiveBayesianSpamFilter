Parents,

Are you TIRED of all the FOUL LANGUAGE on TV, Movies and Videos?!?

We were!  My wife and I didn't want our children hearing Hollywood's slimy language, but we also wanted to watch shows like Law & Order, The Practice, ER, sitcoms and action videos!  
NOW WE CAN - Without the Foul Language!

For just $99.95 and 10 minutes of our time, we hooked up a device that reads the hidden script, and mutes out 95-100% of that disgusting language!  We love it!

If we Parents are ever going to take a stand in our homes against LOW MORALS, now's the time.  Are YOU ready to say, "Not in this home!" - or will you continue letting the garbage roll into your children's ears?  If you're ready, just e-mail us at NotInThisHome@Yahoo.com.  We'll send you more details, and how to order (a fabulous Christmas gift)!

Love your family - Invest in their Morals - TODAY!
Doug and Mae
Kent, Washington

Sorry…Offer only good in the USA.
