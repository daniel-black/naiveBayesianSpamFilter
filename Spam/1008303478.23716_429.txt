It's Personal, It's your digital identity it's a new domain extension just
for individuals

It's .Name  Visit http://www.yournamepromo.com/gdr

It stays with you no matter where or as many times as you move.

You have heard of .com, .net, .org, and the new domains .info and .biz for
web businesses and web addresses. But none of these domain extensions are
personal and none of them are for you the individual.

It's predicted that 20% of all the domain names in use on the web will be
.Name extensions in fact, think about it.How many people have the same
name as you?

The .Name extensions will be selected in a round robin format via domain
registrars.

We have found a site that has created a registrar neutral application
process that enables you to submit once to their site, and they will
submit your request to multiple registrars on your behalf. This process will
significantly increase the odds that you get your name before someone else does.

Examples:
George.Bush.Name
Bush.George.Name
G.Bush.Name
B.George.Name

Also with .Name domain extension you may purchase e-mail forwarding so you
can receive mail addressed to George@Bush.Name
