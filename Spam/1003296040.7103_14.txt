<p align="justify"><FONT face="times new roman" color=black size=5>E<FONT face="times new roman" color=black size=2>arn your MBA from a 9 CD-ROM, Multi-Media Course. This research project is conducted by the well known <b><u>University of Advanced Research - Hawaii Campus</b></u>.  This no tuition program will determine if the average adult, with average responsibilities can complete the required course of study for a graduate degree in 18 weeks from his or her home.  With 3.5 hours of daily study, a student could complete the learning portion of the program within 18 weeks, in preparation for the sturdy final examination.  <u>You may take up to four-years to complete the program if you choose</u>. The minimum completion time for the 9 learning segments is 18 weeks.  The maximum allowable completion time is 4 years.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><FONT face="times roman" color=lightgray size=3><b><u>Key Research Areas</b></u>:
<ul><i></font><FONT face="times roman" color=lightgray size=2>
<li>Age of participants
<li>Education level of participants
<li>Undergraduate Vs. non-undergraduate requirement
<li>Study habits
<li>Examination scores
<li>Jobs accepted after graduation</li></i></ul></font>

<p align="justify"><FONT face="times new roman" color=black size=5>T<FONT face="times new roman" color=black size=2>he normal completion time for the UAR Master's Degree in Business Administration (MBA) is 6 to 9 months.  The tuition is $700.00.  <u><b>You are not required to pay tuition</u></b> to participate in the research project nor are you required to have an undergraduate degree (the usual requirement).  You will earn the same respected credential that our other graduate students earn upon completion of the 9 courses and proctored final examination.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><FONT face="times roman" color=lightgray size=3><b><u>9 Multi-Media Graduate Courses</b></u>:
<ul><i>
<li>1. Marketing
<li>2. Economics
<li>3. Finance
<li>4. Financial Accounting
<li>5. Business Statistics
<li>6. Business Law
<li>7. Organizational Theory
<li>8. Strategic Management
<li>9. Managerial Accounting</li></i></ul>
<p align="justify"><FONT face="times new roman" color=black size=5>O<FONT face="times new roman" color=black size=2>ur graduates work for Fortune 500 companies and a wide array of employers throughout the U.S.  Several of our graduates are elected officials, Doctors, Lawyers, Dentists, Chiropractors, Real Estate Professionals and authors. We have graduates in at least two branches of the U.S. Military. Several foreign dignitaries, to include at least one Ambassador have graduated from our Master's Degree program.  After 10 years of worldwide dedication to academics, the university has students and graduates in the United States, Africa, Antigua, Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, England, Germany, Isreal, Japan, Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia, Netherlands, Panama, Puerto Rico, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sweden, Taiwan and Vietnam.  You will join a global Alumnus family of Master's in Business Administration. Although the university is unaccredited at this time, that has had little to no effect on the 
ceptability of <b><u>degrees earned by our students</u></b>. The primary reason is that <u><b>a professor from an accredited college or university teaches to you his or her specialty on each of the 9 CD-ROM courses in the discipline. Therefore, it is impossible to argue the quality of the education or its method of delivery</b></u>.  Our school is well known (our global classroom spans over 25 countries with a substantial student body) and so are its curricula.  The university has educated entire families and approximately one out of every five new students is a referral from an existing student or graduate.  In fact, 99% of the employers that inquire have only asked for the applicant's enrollment date, graduation date and information about the curriculum. Two of the world's most outstanding universities, Cambridge and Oxford are unaccredited. However, it is important to note that these two exemplary institutions operate with a Royal Charter.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><FONT face="times roman" color=lightgray size=3><b><u>Minimum Requirements</b></u>:
<ul><i></font><FONT face="times roman" color=lightgray size=2>
<li>18 years old
<li>Official (driver license, military I.D.) proof of identity and age

<li>Physical street home address (no p.o. boxes/suites accepted)
<li>IBM compatible computer with Windows 95 or 98 OS only.

<p align="justify"><FONT face="times new roman" color=black size=5>T<FONT face="times new roman" color=black size=2>here are <b><u><font color=red>limited openings available</font></b></u> for this international research project.  This focus group will receive the same benefits as would other graduate students, to include Course Completion Certificates for each of the nine courses, communications with the university, the same final examination and then, the award of the Master's In Business Administration Degree.  You will also receive Official Transcripts for the work you complete during the program.  Because your dossier is made available to employers, it will reflect only your graduation status.  The Registrar will not record notes about your participation in the project in your file.  The Provost of the university maintains project statistics separate from student dossiers.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><FONT face="times new roman" color=black size=5>T<FONT face="times new roman" color=black size=2>here is a $75.00 fee that covers the cost of two Federal Express shipments, one USPS shipment, a classroom copy of all nine cd-roms, and handling.  This is not for profit.  Your tuition is paid for you via a grant from the Delaware NAPL Trust (private association / non-academic benefactor).  Again, this is an important educational research project for the right participants.  Your $75.00 fee is non-refundable and its use is itemized in this paragraph.  The Delaware NAPL Trust prohibits fees greater than $75.00  for miscellaneous hard costs that are non-tuition items.  The results of this research project will be publicly available in June of 2006.  The university bookstore will also offer the dissertation findings of the research project.</font></p>
