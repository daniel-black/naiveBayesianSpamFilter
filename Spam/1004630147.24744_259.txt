        Securities Act, allows for any interested party to invest in the c=
ompany=FFFFFF92s
        securities, subject to the terms of the statute. &quot;The Company=
 has
        taken care to provide a fully qualified Offering Memorandum which =
can
        only be accessed through the internet by first sending in a reques=
t for
        a copy of the memorandum to the Company,&quot; stated Bridges.</p>

        &quot;the purpose of this offering is to expand the shareholder ba=

        the Company. Noir-Cygnus has entered into negotiations to be acqui=
red by
        a publicly-traded shell company. On conclusion of that acquisition=
, and
        assuming the success of our business model, we will need 1,000
        shareholders and the appropriate capital requirements in order to
        qualify for trading on the NASDAQ National Market System.&quot; Wo=
ods
        noted that despite the mood of the country and marketplace, it was
        important to conduct this offering now in view of the <i>de minimu=

        interest rates that are being experienced in the financial markets
        representing an enormous business opportunity. &quot;We must move =
