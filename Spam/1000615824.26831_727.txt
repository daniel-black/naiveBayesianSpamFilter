From: Dave Winsen - Director - High Technology Executive Search  

High Tech Executive Search is an established national Executive Search and 
Consulting Firm who has been serving a variety of Industries for over 25 years. 
We are a member of a National Network of 600other Executive Search firms with 
multiple specialties. Now you can work with one Search Firm and have access 
to over 600 others through one central source.

PLEASE READ CAREFULLY AND RESPOND AS FOLLOWS:

1). Please visit our website atwww.hotjobs2000.comThen review the positions 
in the HOT JOBS section of the site. When you see a good fit (a 90% or better 
match to the Job Order), nominate yourself for the position.Write a cover letter 
addressing your background and greatest accomplishments as it pertains to the 
position(s).  

2). Submit your personalized cover letter and resume and we will do the rest.

This approach is called "The Art of Packaging" and it works. General resumes 
and cover letters are not effective in today's highly competitive market place. 
The more specific you are to the Job Order and Industry the greater are your 
chances in receiving an interview and an offer. 

Resumes must be submitted through the website to be considered for a position.

Let High Tech assist you in getting Interviews and Offers! The time to act 
is now. So don't delay. Revisit us often as there are hundreds of new positions 
posted weekly.

 

Thank-you
