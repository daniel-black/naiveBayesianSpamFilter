MAJOR CONTRACT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND HUGE NEWSLETTER
COVERAGE THIS WEEK FOR DPRI !!!

Revenues for DPRI, a 10-year old, fully-reporting company, have  skyrocketed 600%
higher this year to over $8 Million on substantial US Government and Insurance
Industry contracts. DPRI's client list of over 50 major insurance companies includes
Allstate, Fireman's Fund, Travelers, Liberty Mutual, Prudential, Hartford, and
Nationwide.

We are expecting significant news this week regarding increasing revenue and
contract expansion from DPRI's Fortune 500 customer base. The stock has already
bounced sharply from its 52-week low and will continue moving up immediately. We
think the stock could easily climb above $4 in less than a month.

WE ARE PROJECTING RECORD VOLUME AND PRICE APPRECIATION AS DPRI MAY VERY WELL BE ONE
OF THE MOST UNDERVALUED STOCKS ON THE OTCBB!!!
