Would you like to be secure in your financial future?

Consider the following:

- The stock market has plummeted.
- IRA's are losing money for the first time.
- Almost all financial experts predict a imminent recession.
- We are at war.

What to do with our investments and life savings at a time like this?

The one investment that has not only avoided the pitfalls but has actually thrived 
is REAL ESTATE.

Consider the following:

- If you invested $20,000.00 in stocks one year ago, it would very likely be worth 
$16,000,000 today, or less.

- That same $20,000.00 invested in  real estate in the proper market one year ago 
and the property only performed near national averages (7.4% appreciation) your 
$20,000 in cash would have grown to over $34,000 in equity.

- Tax benefits are whole different story.

- The only way to obtain tax benefits in the stock market or most other markets is 
to lose money. A lot of people have gained tax benefits this year!

- With investment real estate you have tax benefits via the depreciation, for 
example, if you had a $3,000.00 per year positive cash flow from your property, it 
is very likely most of the $3,000.00 would be tax free because of depreciation.

- Speaking of taxes, did you know that you now can purchase investment real estate 
through your self directed IRA, with no taxes or penalties for conversion to a 
real property investment?

- Most importantly We specialize in the best markets nationwide. Our current 
market pick is:

- The nations number one area for corporate relocation

- Expected to out perform the US over the next quarter century

- Population growth averaging 1.45% annually

- Job growth in the service sector of the economy is rising 3% plus annually

- Been rated as one of the lowest housing cost areas in the US
