Dear Canadian users,

In light of the tragic and saddening events that occurred in New York last week, the employees and shareholders of Take-A-Wiz Incorporated offer their heart-felt sympathy and condolences to the families and friends of the victims of this heinous attack.  Our thoughts and prayers go 
out to the victims, the rescue workers, and all the good people involved in this terrible tragedy.

To support the relief efforts for the victims, we will donate 50% of all the proceeds from the sale of our Estate Planning Software, the Will Wizard(tm) and the Power of Attorney Wizard(tm), between September 17 and October 31, 2001 to the UNITED WAY SEPTEMBER 11TH FUND 
(http://september11fund.org/epledge/sept11.cfm).

Please visit our on-line web-store at http://www.take-a-wiz.com to make your purchases and enter this special Donation Code -- GIVE2NYC, which will be valid up to October 30, 2001.

By purchasing our Wizard(tm) software during this time, not only will you have the tools to create a legal Canadian Will and Power of Attorney, but you will also be supporting the families of the victims during this difficult time.

Thank you for your support.

Yours truly,

Richard Khan,
President and C.E.O.,
Take-A-Wiz Incorporated.
