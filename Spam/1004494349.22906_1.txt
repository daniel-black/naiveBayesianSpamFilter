 	This 4 in 1 Super Pen (PDA Stylus, Pencil and Red, Blue Ball
Point Pen) is yours  Free! 
No more Frustration looking for the right Pen! 

This lightweight efficient writing instrument lets you quickly switch
from PDA stylus, to blue or red ballpoint pen, to a mechanical pencil by
just depressing top button when you are looking at the indicator printed
on the barrel. Fits comfortably in your hand with a no-slip metal
textured grip. Everything you need is right at hand. So it's ideal for
working on plane, in train and any cramped quarter. And now you can
travel light at work or on the road with just this one Super "pen,"
instead of a pocketful of things. The 4-in-1 pen reduces clutter and
ends the frustration and wasted time of looking for the right instrument
or switch between stylus and pen. Retract with quick release side
button. Refills with high-lighter and black ball point pen are
available. 

*	Blue ballpoint pen and reloadable pencil. 
*	Highlighter for marking documents. 
*	Acts as a stylus for your organizer. 
*	Change functions with the click of a button.
