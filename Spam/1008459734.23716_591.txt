Make $6,000 to $20,000 in just 6 weeks unless
you screw up. If you screw up you will make 
less. 
If you TOTALLY SCREW UP and do nothing 
right, If you don't sponsor anyone, If you 
totally blow it you will only make $1,750.00


So if you only make $1,750.00 that is your 
fault. If you are serious you will make the 
BIG BUCKS in a very short time.
