<FONT size=3> Starving For Leads ??<BR>
<BR>
Let's face it business people, without a lead we're all out of business.<BR>
Without a GOOD lead, we're out that new Lexus or trip to Maui !!<BR>
If you're in business, odds are you're becoming VERY aware of how GOOD the<BR>
quality is of an internet lead.<BR>
<BR>
Bulk email is the future of marketing. It is THE MOST EFFECTIVE way to get<BR>
YOU'RE information into the hands of people who ACTUALLY WANT IT!<BR>
<BR>
No matter how big or small your company may be, you can enjoy the benefits<BR>
of getting your product or service in front of millions of people. <BR>
<BR>
Research shows that most advertisers have tried one or more of the following:<BR>
<BR>
Free Classifieds? (Don't work anymore)<BR>
Web Site? (Takes thousands of visitors)<BR>
Banners? (Expensive and losing their punch)<BR>
E-zines? (Hope they have a huge subscriber list)<BR>
Search Engines (Forget it, unless you're in the top 20)<BR>
<BR>
WHAT WORKS? EMAIL MARKETING.<BR>
