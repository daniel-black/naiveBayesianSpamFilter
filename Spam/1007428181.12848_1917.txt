Here's some amazing FACTS ABOUT BABY BOOMERS:  A "Boomer" is a person born between 1946 and 1964.  
Over 76 million people were born during that period in the U.S. and over 1 Billion worldwide.  
Never in history has there been such a population explosion.  
1/3rd of the total U.S. population was born during those years.  
Boomers control over 65% of all the wealth.   
Boomers reshape every industry they go through.
Gerber sold over 1.8 jars of baby food by 1955.  
Soon after that, companies like Buster Brown and Kinney shoes experienced explosive growth.  
Then, as Boomers began to reach the "playing" ages, companies like Mattel and Hasbro toys had record sales.  
In 1957 more elementary schools were built than in the entire 12 years prior.  
McDonalds, Dairy Queen and Kentucky Fried Chicken were the next companies to see the "Boomer wave".  We know what happened with those companies.  
In the mid-1970's the Boomers, when many were reaching their 30's, started buying their first homes and the Real Estate Boom hit.  

Wherever & whenever the Boomers have been & passed - those Industries that took advantage of the "boomer wave" had incredible growth.
