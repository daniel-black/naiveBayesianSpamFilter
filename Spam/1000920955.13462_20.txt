<b>Go</b> ahead and treat yourself. It's not every day you are kind to yourself, always putting others first, doing without, so that the rest of the

pieces are gorgeous. So go ahead and splurge. Give the free brooch as a gift to your daughter, mother, sister, cousin, for 
that special occasion, they will never know you got it so cheap, it's so beautiful. <P>Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, I'm doing it 
again! For every customer you refer who spends <B>$20.00 before shipping</B> I will give YOU another
