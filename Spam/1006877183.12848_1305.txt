Hard work is over rated!!

The reality today is that the people who physically work the hardest are 
paid the least and taxed the most. Times have changed.

In the Industrial Age, people retired at age 65 because they were often too 
worn out to lift tires and put engines into a car on the assembly line.

Many people struggle financially simply because they have their parents' 
ideas about money. Many people go to school and get good jobs because that 
is what their parents did or advised them to do. Many struggle financially, 
or live paycheck to paycheck because that is what their parents did.

With the birth of the information age and the World Wide Web, many of the 
rules have changed.

The WWW has changed what it costs to join that elusive '10% which control 
90% of the world's wealth'. Today you don't need to be born into a wealthy 
family. And it does not require massive sums of money, land and labor.

For the first time in world history, the 90/10 rule to wealth may no longer 
apply. No longer does it take money to make money. No longer does it take 
vast tracts of land or resources to become rich. No longer does it matter 
what university you went to, or what sex, race or religion you are a part.

For some people the hardest thing to change is an old idea. It is time to 
think outside the box!

Some say that the Internet craze is much like the California Gold Rush of 
the 1850s. The only difference is that you do not need to leave your home to 
participate. The WWW, has made it possible to do business with the 
rest of the world from the living room of your family home.
