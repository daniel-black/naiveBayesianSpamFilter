URGENT MESSAGE!<br>
<br>
PLEASE READ COMPLETELY<br>
<br>
It is important that you read this message as soon as possible. Again, I urge
<br>
you to read this message to its fullest! Last year 72% of all bankruptcies <br>
filed could have been avoided by adding just an extra $200 a month to the <br>
household income. We are an International E-Commerce and Mail Order <br>
Company. We are looking for people with a Good Work Ethic and the <br>
Desire to Earn $500 - $1,500 per Month Part Time or $2,000 - $7,500+ <br>
per Month Full Time Working from Home or Office! <br>
<br>
The demand for our product line (over 150 different products) is so great we <br>
need to train more people to process the orders and service our growing <br>
customer base. Right now, our industry is practically still in its infancy, but
<br>
by the year 2010, will be a $1 Trillion Dollar Industry!!!<br>
<br>
To better assist you in understanding E-Commerce and what the world is <br>
raving about with E-Commerce and the Internet, I URGE you to read this <br>
message for your own benefit in understanding what it can do for you. <br>
<br>
We are helping people start both local and foreign business. This opportunity
<br>
is the fastest growing industry in India, Panama, Cypress, Korea, China, and <br>
Japan and, of course, the United States. <br>
<br>
This U.S. Based Company is growing by leaps and bounds, at home and <br>
around the world. We are currently doing business in over 53 countries with <br>
80% growth expected in the next three years. And the best part is, new <br>
countries are opening every day. If you can imagine, the Internet and <br>
E-Commerce is currently expanding by 200% each quarter. <br>
<br>
Our company is expected to reach the world in the next 4 years and with <br>
that, there will be a 2000% increase in our E-Commerce Business and <br>
revenues on the Internet in the next 18 Months. No special skills or <br>
experience are required. We will give you all the training and personal <br>
support that you need to assure your success. You will be trained via <br>
Internet in the comfort of your own home and you will determine your <br>
work hours. A minimum commitment of 7-10 hours a week is required. <br>
<br>
The income you generate from your efforts can put you back in control of <br>
your Time, Your Finances and Your Life! You may have tried other <br>
opportunities in the past that failed to live up to their promises; this is <br>
different than anything else you are aware of! This is not a get rich <br>
scheme. You must work to earn income! Your financial past does not<br>
have to be your financial future.<br>
<br>
&quot;There is no security on this earth. There is only opportunity.&quot; <br>
Douglas McArthur<br>
<br>
Do you feel like you are too busy earning a living to make any real money? <br>
Are you tired of living &quot;paycheck to paycheck&quot; like I was? Do you dream <br>
of a better lifestyle for yourself and your family? If so, then I urge you to
<br>
read on to better understand why I sent you this message. We provide the <br>
system, experience and hands on training. The only thing that we can not <br>
give you, but is required is that you, have the desire and that you are <br>
teachable. We know that you have some level of desire because you are <br>
reading this letter. Ask yourself if you are teachable? <br>
<br>
This business fell into my lap in September of 1997. I got started as a <br>
customer or consumer and woke up when my wife made an extra $500 <br>
in the first week. At the time I was an Active Duty Marine living paycheck <br>
to paycheck making less that $19,000 a year. I was attending college at <br>
a local University and had two children. An extra $500/month would have <br>
been a dream come true. We got started and in our first month earned <br>
$2700 profit. In the first four months my wife and I made $19,000 profit. In <br>
just 4 months time, that’s more than I made in an entire year as an active <br>
duty Marine just part time working 10 - 12 hrs a week. <br>
<br>
Everyone involved in our business had three things in common when they <br>
got started:<br>
<br>
1. They saw an opportunity; <br>
2. They were teachable; and <br>
3. They applied what they learned. <br>
<br>
It's THAT simple. And it's THAT POWERFUL.<br>
<br>
*************************************<br>
<br>
Imagine just for a moment that you have a home-based business that <br>
provides more time with your family, Unlimited income based on YOUR efforts, <br>
Freedom from commuting, Not having your kids in day care, Affordable health <br>
care for your family, Significantly helping others with their lives, Loving what
<br>
you do and doing what you love, Having your own business/being your own <br>
boss Sounds too good to be true? That's what we thought, but today our <br>
dreams are coming true and now we want to help you, as others have <br>
helped us!<br>
<br>
**********************************************<br>
<br>
We like to get right to the point...so here is what we have to offer you: <br>
<br>

<br>
ARE YOU GETTING A BIT CURIOUS?<br>
<br>
GREAT! That's fine... as long as you're serious! <br>
<br>
The average person can start earning from $25.00 - $75.00 an hour from <br>
their home or office computers without dedicating a lot of time and effort. <br>
Most of us have been thinking it's about time that we took advantage of <br>
this Internet Craze. Throughout the Holidays and especially the last year, <br>
everything that we have seen on Television and heard on the radio has <br>
either started or ended with www.com and the reason why is because <br>
the Internet has truly simplified shopping, which frees up more time for all <br>
of us to turn into quality time. Security and convenience has been <br>
technologically advanced to give us all peace of mind. E-Commerce is <br>
so rampant right now that in most states in the U.S. you can buy groceries <br>
over the Internet. <br>
<br>
This is your chance to take advantage of the E-commerce that is literally <br>
changing the way the world does business. Our marketing group will show <br>
you how you can work at home using your very own E-Commerce Storefront. <br>
You can work at home and use the Internet to run your business. You can <br>
market our high demand consumable products that are geared and driven by <br>
the needs of over 80% of the world's population. Our products sell themselves;
<br>
there is no selling or need for out right sales techniques. Also, because they
<br>
are high demand consumable products, return business, ongoing business, and <br>
referral business is generated. By working at home, you reduce overhead, set <br>
your own schedule, are your own boss, and achieve your own goals. Be an <br>
entrepreneur, WORK AT HOME!<br>
<br>
Our company has been reviewed and published Wall Street Journal, Business <br>
Week, Home PC, Forbes, Success, and Money, just to name a few. The <br>
Market Opportunity is colossal. Over 2/3 of American homes have a computer, <br>
and E-Commerce sales are increasing month after month. <br>
<br>
The top industries in the world are <br>
<br>
• Medical<br>
• Health <br>
• Nutrition<br>
• Computer Industry<br>
• Personal Care <br>
• Communication and <br>
• the Burial Business<br>
<br>
Due to the aging population of Baby Boomers, these industries are increasing <br>
daily, and will continue at this rate for the next several years. With the <br>
exception of the Burial Business, The Work at Home Network puts them all into
<br>
one package. <br>
<br>
One of the strongest aspects of our business is the ongoing training that is <br>
offered. We have International Training on an ongoing basis in most major <br>
cities. Weekly conference calls are also available, as well as satellite <br>
television training programs, online training, monthly magazines and quarterly
<br>
journals. <br>
<br>
Our company does over 2.1 billion (USD) in business annually and you can be <br>
a part of this growth. You will find success because we give you the blueprint
<br>
to follow and support your need to develop your own profitable home-based <br>
business. <br>
<br>
All we ask of you is to be willing and able to be coached and to learn. We have
<br>
no need for tire-kickers or window shoppers. Please do not request our <br>
&quot;decision package&quot; if you are not serious about changing the course of your <br>
life. By ordering your &quot;decision package&quot;, you will receive all you need to get
<br>
yourself moving towards financial independence. <br>
<br>
If you are tired of worrying about money and tired of choosing what you can live
<br>
without, come join the thousands of us working from home, setting our own <br>
schedules, making a fortune and living out our dreams. We invite you to explore
<br>
how the &quot;Work From Home&quot; Internet Program capitalizes on today's <br>
advancements in technology to help you build a successful home-based <br>
business. Have you noticed the surge of people looking to start home-based <br>
businesses? Did you know that 32 million households now have home-based <br>
businesses and that number grows every day? Have you asked yourself, &quot;Why?&quot; <br>
Why are so many people, including yourself, interested in working from home? <br>
<br>
Our parents did not search for a business to operate from home nor did their <br>
friends. So, why now is it suddenly so popular? <br>
<br>
Americans are &quot;cocooning&quot;. We want to spend less time on the busy freeways <br>
and in over-crowded shopping malls and replace that by spending more time at <br>
home with our families where it is safe and warm. This is the wave of the <br>
future and we are beginning to realize with the advancement of technology, <br>
that we do not need to be in an office environment in order to access the <br>
marketplace and make money. In today's world, the quickest way to build a <br>
home-based business is to take advantage of the Internet craze that has hit <br>
the United States and is quickly spreading around the world. <br>
<br>
While a conventional business can cost thousands to hundreds of thousands of <br>
dollars to set up and run successfully, an Internet business costs dramatically
<br>
less and has the potential to attract international business for just a fraction
<br>
of what the traditional company would spend. On average, 30% of all U.S. <br>
web traffic is already international and 5% to 20% of all web sales originate
<br>
from outside the United States. Everyday, these percentages are radically <br>
increasing. Consumers worldwide are spending 6.6 billion U.S. dollars a year <br>
in transactions over the Internet. <br>
<br>
The awareness level and need for users, buyers, advertisers and merchants to <br>
get onto the Web, and to set-up shop, has dramatically changed even from one <br>
year ago. This medium of doing business is skyrocketing, and we are reaping <br>
the benefits daily. <br>
<br>
If you combine the Internet craze with people's desire to work from home and <br>
set their own schedule, you have a powerful team, and here is why. Many <br>
people have heard of SOHO, and no, we don't mean that hip section of New <br>
York City, rather the S.O.H.O. which refers to &quot;Small Office/Home Office.&quot; One
<br>
of today's the biggest explosions in the economy. The home-based business <br>
has been born out of necessity. In an era where large corporations can only <br>
think of downsizing, what are your options? There is no security in Corporate
<br>
America any more! Not only are tens of thousands of workers and managers <br>
being downsized out of their companies, but also thousands of men and <br>
women are tired of the corporate &quot;rat race&quot; and want to retreat to a <br>
home-based business. <br>
<br>
If you decide to &quot;stick it out&quot; in Corporate America your choices could boil <br>
down to finding a lucrative niche in the small business world, standing in line
<br>
at the unemployment office, or accepting a cut in pay and benefits. We were <br>
all raised to give 9 hours work for 8 hours pay, and we are not backing away <br>
from that. <br>
<br>
Today's large companies have no loyalty to their employees. Their only loyalty
<br>
is to the bottom line. And the bottom line is exactly where most of us are when
<br>
it's time to cut back. Your life is suddenly turned upside down because you <br>
have no control over your future. Someone who has no idea of the quality of <br>
your work or the extra time you gave the company without requesting overtime <br>
makes these decisions behind closed doors. They don't know about your <br>
family's life: they don't understand that you just put braces on your child's
<br>
teeth and now have to pay for them. The job of these &quot;decision makers&quot; is to <br>
be impersonal and unbiased in all areas except for the company's &quot;best <br>
interests.&quot; <br>
<br>
In other words: TO THEM, YOU REALLY DON'T MATTER.<br>
<br>
The Great American Dream is gone. Official U.S. Government reports indicate <br>
that more than 3.5 million jobs have been eliminated in the past 10 years - <br>
including over 2000 jobs per day last year alone - and an estimated 55% of all
<br>
jobs created in the next 10 years will be near minimum wage in stores, <br>
restaurants, and bars. 90% of all the people in North America earn less than <br>
$40,000 year and today’s two-income families are not living as well as their <br>
parents did on a single income. <br>
<br>
So what is the alternative to the to the Great American Job? <br>
<br>
Richard Poe, former Senior Editor - &quot;Success Magazine,&quot; describes in his <br>
recent book that a shift in thinking has resulted in over 14 million people <br>
working from home full-time, and another 13 million part-time. This number is
<br>
increasing by almost 600,000 per year. And the average work from home income <br>
is $50,250 per year, about twice the average income of wage earners working <br>
for someone else. By the end of the decade over 44% of us will be working <br>
from home. <br>
<br>
Home based business wage earner's success rate exceeds 85% compared <br>
with small businesses such as retail shops and restaurants, that average 95% <br>
failure rate within 5 years. Couple that with the flexibility we have to change
<br>
our schedules and set our hours. Those of us who are parents are now <br>
available when our children need us, plus we no longer have the need for the <br>
&quot;foster homes&quot; we call day care centers, where the care-givers get to see all
<br>
the &quot;firsts&quot; your child performs. <br>
<br>
There's no wonder the number of people looking to work from home has <br>
skyrocketed. <br>
<br>
Imagine what it would be like to run an international operation if you so chose,
<br>
right from the comfort of your own home. This is exactly what we offer! We <br>
offer &quot;freedom&quot; that is available through a constant flow of income that does
<br>
not depend on the whims of a boss, bonuses or the economy. <br>
<br>
Take a look at some of these statistics: At age 50, 75% of the population <br>
has less than $5,000 in the bank for retirement. At age 65, 45% of <br>
Americans depend on relatives, 30% depend on charities, 23% are still <br>
working (most can't afford to quit and end up working until they are no longer
<br>
physically capable) and Only 2% are self-sustaining. <br>
<br>
At the present time, it is impossible to support a family of two working <br>
full-time at minimum wage! For the first time in history, the current generation
<br>
is averaging a lower standard of living than their parents! Automation is <br>
taking layoffs to record highs! According to some recent government figures, <br>
out of 100 people in the United States at age 65...<br>
<br>
• 28 are dead<br>
• 62 are broke or dependent on the system making less than $4000 per <br>
year.<br>
• 5 are still working<br>
• 4 are financially independent<br>
• 1 can be considered RICH <br>
<br>
Not taking into account those who are dead at 65, this means that 93% of <br>
Americans retire broke or must keep working beyond retirement! <br>
<br>
Will Social In-Security be there for you? Will you be dead? Do you intend to <br>
keep on working? <br>
<br>
Why not be financially independent or rich!?<br>
<br>
Over the past decade, Fortune 500 companies have laid off 4.4 million workers
<br>
while smaller companies steadily continue to reduce their work forces. As <br>
companies continue to downsize and re-organize, many professionals will seek <br>
out new ways to take control of their careers. Many of these individuals have
<br>
forsworn traditional &quot;nine to five&quot; office jobs and are making their homes pay
<br>
off in more ways than one. For the entrepreneur, home-based businesses <br>
have become the bridge between work- crazed big cities and easy- paced <br>
family-oriented small towns. Thanks to the Internet, it is no longer necessary
<br>
to live in close proximity to &quot;Big Business&quot;. You can now operate that &quot;Big <br>
Business&quot; right from your home office. <br>
<br>
Check out these Statistics: 11% of the US market is now on the Internet <br>
1,092,000 new people get Internet access each week, while approximately <br>
38% of the US adult population, or 68 million US citizens' currently use the <br>
Internet, according to the fall 1999 Cyber Status reports from Mediamark <br>
Research Inc. This is an increase of 49% from the prior quarter, and this <br>
study only counts people who have used the Internet in the last 30 days. <br>
<br>
Ziff-Davis' Technology User Profile reported that there are 60 million PC's <br>
connected to the Internet in the US, but home PC's still represent the lion's
<br>
share of the market, with 68 million consumers hooked up to the Internet. <br>
They predict that up to $54 billion US dollars will change hands from business
<br>
transactions online this year. <br>
<br>
Most people are ready to do some sort of business online, they just don't know
<br>
where to start. This is why we are so successful. We link-up our marketing <br>
techniques with something people need, and most of all, something people want.
<br>
<br>
If you add strong work ethics, a powerful support system, along with personal
<br>
business coaching, you can't help but be successful. We provide not only the <br>
vehicle that puts you on the road to success, but we also provide the map. <br>
All you have to do is be teachable, have the desire for a better life and be <br>
willing to change what you're doing now. 94% of home-based business owners <br>
are happier running their own business versus working for someone else. 92% <br>
recommend working from home to others. 94% plan to still be running their own
<br>
business in five years. 20% of home entrepreneurs reported that their businesses
<br>
grossed between $100,000 and $500,000 last year. 23% paid themselves annual <br>
salaries of $65,000 to $350,000. 41% work at home with other family members. <br>
71% think their businesses are doing as well or better than they expected. 79%
<br>
expect their home-based business revenues to grow this year. Your search <br>
for the ideal work environment and for the ideal vehicle to wealth is over. <br>
You will be able to work more flexible hours while increasing your productivity,
<br>
not to mention drastically cutting or eliminating your commute time, and <br>
increasing your most precious commodity-quality of life. <br>
<br>
We have developed one of the most exciting, technologically advanced <br>
home-based businesses that will take you through the new millennium. We <br>
don't expect you to come to us with tremendous business knowledge or a <br>
successful track record. We have already figured out how to make this work; <br>
all you need to do is copy what we're already doing. <br>
<br>
Since you've gotten this far, we know you are serious about working from home.
<br>
Your next step will help you make some changes and learn some new skills. <br>
So, let's go! <br>
<br>
As you know, this is not a lay-on-the-couch, get-rich-quick scheme. This is a
<br>
REAL business and a real opportunity- one that has drawn so much interest <br>
from people that we had to put this screening process in place to help us <br>
determine who to work with. Our company has been in business for more <br>
than 20 years, is publicly held and traded on the NASDAQ. It is important <br>
that you realize that we can help you build a powerful and profitable business.
<br>
<br>
We have an explosive, start to finish, proven Internet Marketing system. And <br>
we are offering you this simple easy method where you can make money <br>
working for yourself, over the Internet, from the comfort of your home or <br>
office. You can earn $1,000 to $7,000 per month working around your <br>
current job and your family's schedule. Our system works regardless of your <br>
background or computer knowledge. We provide the system, experience <br>
and hands on training. <br>
<br>
Our business is bursting at the seams, so we ONLY have time to work with <br>
serious, motivated people who are ready to make changes in their life NOW! <br>
And because of the time we spend with each of you as we help you get your <br>
business off the ground, we have a limited number of openings available. Here
<br>
is what you need to do... <br>
<br>
STEP 1. You must call our toll free &quot;International Internet Business hotline and
<br>
listen to some of the members of our team talk about the success of their new
<br>
home based businesses. EVEN IF YOU ARE CALLING THIS NUMBER <br>
INTERNATIONALLY, I URGE YOU TO CALL RIGHT NOW. This is part of <br>
our job-to introduce you to many others who took a step of faith (like you're
<br>
ready to), and whose lives have changed because of it.<br>
<br>
This call is for everyone. i.e. former Military Service Members, Executive <br>
Professionals and Laborers, Doctors and Nurses 1-800-708-RICH and enter <br>
Access Code 2552 or 4400; then to learn about our industry and company <br>
dial 1-800-555-1795 and enter Access Code 2552 or 4400.<br>
<br>
This 10-minute call is a 24-hour toll free for all that is in the United States;
<br>
however if you are International I urge you to dial this number now and listen
<br>
to this short message and take some notes. <br>
<br>
**********************************************<br>
CAUTION! This Access Code expires on Jan 5th 2002 <br>
(So call right now!)<br>
<br>
**********************************************<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT! DO NOT PROCEED TO STEP 2 UNTIL YOU HAVE LISTENED <br>
TO THE CALL MENTIONED IN STEP 1<br>
<br>
**********************************************<br>
<br>
If you are unsure and need more information, we have put together a &quot;How to <br>
do business over the Internet&quot; decision package that will help you determine <br>
whether our business is for you or not. This step is only for individuals who
<br>
have the desire to control their own future and who want to work from their <br>
homes and earn the kind of income that will give you the life you deserve. <br>
This decision package contains approximately three hours of information <br>
about our explosive Internet business and it also begins your training. You <br>
will receive a manual that explains how, why and what we are doing, a <br>
video where you'll meet us and see exactly how our business works and <br>
an audiotape to further help you with your decision. Your package also <br>
contains the name and telephone number of your personal coach who will <br>
be working with you on a daily basis, helping you make money in your first <br>
week. In other words, you will receive all of the information you will need to
<br>
make a decision to determine if this is for you. <br>
<br>
After you request your &quot;International Decision Package&quot;, and go through all <br>
the materials, we will call you and your personal training program will begin.
<br>
At that point, we will also be happy to locate the nearest training to you, <br>
which are available in numerous translations. We have training being <br>
conducted in over 39 different languages worldwide! <br>
<br>
This package acts only as a way for you to review information about our <br>
business and begins your training without risk. This step eliminates the people
<br>
who are not serious and allows us to work with those of you who are. Please <br>
recognize the importance of this step. We simply do not have the time to spend
<br>
with people who are merely curious, which is why we designed this package to <br>
provide you with all of the information you will need to make a decision and <br>
determine if this is for you. If we spent our time answering e-mail requests for
<br>
additional information, we'd not only be duplicating the effort we put into <br>
developing the decision package, but we'd also be taking valuable time away <br>
from running our business and training new people. Once you start working <br>
with us, we're sure you will appreciate our spending time training you instead
<br>
of responding to curious e-mails all day long. <br>
<br>
Since we don't spend countless hours answering the tireless questions of the <br>
curiosity-seekers, you benefit, because it frees us up in order to dedicate <br>
ourselves to your success. When we spend time with you, we know we are <br>
working with someone who, like us, is committed to a better lifestyle. What is
<br>
Your Future Worth? Decide for yourself and for your family what it is you want
<br>
and by when you want to achieve it. Only you can determine how dedicated <br>
you are to achieving your dreams. <br>
<br>
Hopefully, you won't find yourself relying on your friends and family for <br>
direction and salvation. They cannot provide that for you - only you can do <br>
that. You need to make a decision to either give this a shot or to continue <br>
down the path you're on. Most likely, if you have read this far, you have <br>
already made the decision to make some healthy changes in your life. When <br>
we were looking at this &quot;Work From Home&quot; Opportunity for the first time, just
<br>
like you, we were nervous and thought that maybe this wouldn't work. Like <br>
you, we doubted we could really achieve our dreams. We went for it any way <br>
and now we are making an incredible income, working from home, and for <br>
most of us- it's a dream come true. We don't have a boss to answer to or a <br>
clock to punch.<br>
<br>
All you need to do now is take action. Take action by ordering your &quot;Decision
<br>
Package&quot; and we'll be there to help you through your questions and then to <br>
work with you to build your own &quot;Work From Home&quot; Internet Business. But <br>
please don't request more information unless you are committed to improving <br>
your life. If you are ready to learn and you are serious about achieving a <br>
brighter future and a better life, then we are committed to you. We are ready
<br>
to give you the same step-by-step plan we used to build our fortune. There will
<br>
be no surprises. We know exactly what to do and how to coach others to be <br>
successful within the same system. Our Program works. It's already happening <br>
for hundreds of people. Why not you? Right now, take the next step, and get <br>
started on your way to a brighter lifestyle. <br>
<br>
STEP 2: To get started request your decision package only after you have <br>
completed STEP 1 please call our international 24 hour order hotline at <br>
1-206-222-2826. International callers and for United States, Canada, and <br>
Mexico callers please also dial 1-206-222-2826. <br>
<br>
We are willing to train you and work with you, as others have done with us, to
<br>
help secure your financial future. But remember we only work with those that <br>
truly have the desire and ambitions to work-we don't have time to work with <br>
couch potatoes! Successful people do what unsuccessful people won't. <br>
<br>
So develop a sense of urgency and give your desires value! <br>
Procrastination is the biggest killer of success and you can now break that 
cycle! <br>
<br>
REMEMBER, for things to change, you have to change and for things to get better,
<br>
you have to get better. <br>
<br>
Order your materials today, and when they arrive, review everything thoroughly
<br>
BEFORE calling your personal coach.<br>
<br>
Remember the importance of following directions- we are looking for people <br>
who are teachable and willing to work. We're very excited about our future and
<br>
we know you will be, too!! Until we speak personally, thank you and have a <br>
great day! <br>
<br>
