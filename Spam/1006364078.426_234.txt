20,000 Guaranteed Visitors to your Site! Real People. Real Traffic.

Forget the search engines! No pay-per-placement, FFA pages, and no 
spam!

Dear Cdnet.com Submitter,

This time of year, many are thinking about visitors for the holidays. But 
what about visitors to your web site? A lot of emphasis is placed on 
positioning your site on the search engines. While this is important, we've
got a new service that's even better. 

How would you like to forget about all these marketing tactics and stop 
worrying if you are doing it right or wrong and just get traffic to your site? 
How would you like to get 20,000 or more visitors to your site this month, 
without worrying about whether your site is listed in the search engines? 
No FFA pages, classified ads, and no spam! Well, now you can!

Our company will drive real visitors right to your site by advertising on our 
high-traffic site network and we guarantee you 20,000 hits to your site in 
60 days or 
less! And you won't believe how inexpensive it is. The service is 
backed by our money back guarantee and has been succesfully used by 
companies such as MSN, ESPN, AT&T, Ebay and many more. If it's good 
enough for them, isn't it good enough for your site too? You bet it is!

Right now we are offering a super-low price (save over 40%) on this 
service for our site users. But you must act before November 26th.

You must use the link above to receive the special discount. This offer is 
for our site users only. Please note: while we are extending this special 
offer, we accept only a limited number of sites, on a first come-first served 
basis.

Getting people to your site is critical for your success. We can help.

Sincerely,

The Staff at Cdnet.com
