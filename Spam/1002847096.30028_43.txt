SugarSlim has 70% less calories than regular sugar. Use SugarSlim cup for cup 
in any recipe that calls for sugar. SugarSlim can be used in baking, cooking 
and table use.

Now, a sugar substitute is available that cuts those calories without leaving 
that fabled after-taste experienced by using aspartame, stevia, or saccharin 
in your low calorie recipes!

Get slim on any diet with SugarSlim!

It is staggering to think of the amount of sugar the average person consumes 
in a year. It is even more astonishing that over-consumption of processed 
sugar has been linked to a number of widespread health problems including 
diabetes, heart disease, high blood-pressure, immune disorders and a wide 
number of other disorders, not to mention its direct correlation with obesity. 

Are you diabetic? Do know someone who is? Do you wish that you (or someone 
you care about) could eat those favorite foods that diabetes or other health 
issues prohibit due to sugar?  SugarSlim can be used in Diabetic's Exchange. 
One tsp is a free exchange. These ingredients do not significantly raise your 
blood glucose or insulin levels.

Visit our website to order or to get more info.

SugarSlim has been advertised on the Home Shopping Network at a price of $22.
95 for a 3# can of this ‘granulated’ sugar substitute.  Buy it direct from us 
for $17.95!

Order it at www.sugarslim.com or call us at (800) 992-3866.  Let me repeat - 
SugarSlim has NO AFTERTASTE!  SugarSlim tastes like sugar!
