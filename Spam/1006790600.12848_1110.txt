Testimonial: I had a skin cancer removed 2 times from my face. I decided when it came
back to use Chickweed Healing Salve. Within 2 weeks it was gone. I also used it on a leg ankle that was swollen. It went down and the soreness was gone too. Thanks for the help. Raymond Davis New Washington, IN 812-293-3555
Testimonial: I had places on my face that were diagnosed as skin cancer. I saw an ad in the paper on Chickweed Healing Salve. I decided it was worth a try. I used it morning and night for about two weeks. Now I use it at night. The places are almost gone. I have used it faithfully since June 6th, 2001. I wouldn't be without it. Shirley Davis New Washington, IN  812-293-3555
Testimonial: My newly born baby, now one month old, had chronic diaper rash. Several doctors had tried to get it to go away...nothing seemed to work, she continued to be raw and sore. She cried all the time. I tried your Chickweed Healing Salve, putting it on that night. By the next morning she was much better. After using it for 2 days, she was completely cured. She is now a beautiful baby. She doesn't cry anymore. I paid $19.95 for it, however I would gladly have paid $100. Thanks so much. I will always keep it on hand. I will gladly give your product a good reference if anyone wants to give me a call. Shellie Cooper Stanly, KS 913-402-0411

Testimonial: I had a rash under my arm for 9 months. I tried a lot of salves and lotions but nothing worked until I tried Chickweed Healing Salve .

Testimonial: I have had a  case of Psoriasis on my scalp for years. I tried Chickweed Healing Salve by rubbing it into the spots at night. It's really good at keeping it under control.
