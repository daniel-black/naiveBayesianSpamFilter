OTCBB Stock Alert's Last Two Picks:

CPTH from $ .55 to $3.05 for a GAIN OF OVER 400%!
NVTL from $ .31 to $1.24 for a GAIN OF OVER 300%!

HERE IS OUR NEXT EXPLOSIVE STOCK PICK:
Royal Finance, Inc. (OTCBB: ROYA)
BUY AT $1.25
SELL TARGET $5.25 = DIAMOND PLAY !

MAJOR CONTRACT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND HUGE NEWSLETTER
COVERAGE FOR ROYA !

Revenues for ROYA, a fully-reporting, multi-faceted
financial services firm, have skyrocketed 500% higher
this year due to 10 Federal Reserve interest rate cuts,
placing rates at their lowest levels in over 4 decades.

ROYA is experiencing record breaking loan volume, real
estate sales, and mortgage refinancing as the rush is
on with rates having dropped to bargain basement levels.

We are expecting significant news regarding increasing 
revenue and significant aquisitions, enhancing
the bottom line for rapid revenue growth.  The stock has
already bounced sharply from its 52-week low and will
continue moving up immediately. We think the stock could
easily climb above $5 in less than a month.

WE ARE PROJECTING RECORD VOLUME AND PRICE APPRECIATION
AS ROYA MAY VERY WELL BE ONE OF THE MOST UNDERVALUED
STOCKS ON THE OTCBB!
