<FONT color=3D"#000000"> ; state agencies are simply too understaffed!  St=

As our national and local media remind us every day, millions of custodial=
 parents are struggling to raise their families without the child support =
to which they are entitled. In fact, you or someone you know is probably t=
ackling this problem right now. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#FFFFFF"> This Child Support Collection Course teaches you =
to recover your own child support payments. Or you can learn to help other=
s in need, earning about 25% to 30% of what is collected.  That translates=
 to $4,000 . . . $8,000 . . .even $12,000 earned each month collecting for=
 others! You'd be hard-pressed to come up with any other legal business op=
portunity that allows you to earn such a significant income while performi=
ng such a valuable community service. </FONT>

Not only do you have the potential to make thousands of dollars a month re=
covering delinquent child support payments, you'll also "earn" the gratitu=
de of custodial parents and their children who are finally receiving the m=
oney they're due! <BR>
<BR>
You might be thinking a successful child support recovery business would r=
equire a difficult time commitment or a lot of expensive equipment. Not at=
 all! You can make thousands of dollars each month, part-time or full-time=
, working from your home, with only a telephone and a home computer! <BR>
<BR>
This course places you at the leading edge of a major national trend, name=
ly, privatizing the recovery of delinquent child support payments. Whereas=
 the government succeeds only one fifth of the time in this area, well-tra=
ined private parties are doing four times better! <BR>
<BR>
And remember every time you recover a payment, you can earn 25% to 30% of =
what you find! <BR>

</FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#FFFFFF"><U> We provide step by step instructions for you t=
o follow, enabling you to collect all back-owed child support for yourself=
 or anyone else you choose. It is not necessary to have in-depth legal kno=
wledge or even a college education.</U></FONT>

According to the Department of Health and Human Services, absent parents i=
n the United States have a big bill to pay: $32 billion in delinquent chil=
d support payments. That is over 15 million cases, with 1.5 million new ca=
ses added every year. More than half of court-ordered child support cases =
become delinquent at some time, and in more than one fourth of cases, no p=
ayments are ever made. <BR>
<BR>
Children deserve and need the support they have been awarded, but governme=
nt agencies aren't offering any real help because they are totally over wh=
elmed. In fact, the agencies are so flooded with requests that they only c=
ollect about 18% of the child support money they go after. In other words,=
 the government typically has an 82% failure rate! No private business cou=
ld survive with that kind of record, and the impact on children can be dev=
astating. <BR>
<BR>
Statistics show that after a divorce, an absent parent's available income =
goes up 43%, while the custodial parent's spending money goes down 20%. <B=
R>
<BR>
</FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#FFFFFF"> With your help, children in need have a four-time=
s-greater chance of receiving the money they are due than if they relied o=
n the government for recovery. </FONT>

One mother has told us that working with the government to find an absent =
parent "is like beating your head against a brick wall. The frustration an=
d futility you feel are enormous. Agencies crawl at a snails pace, and aut=
horities often lose files or seem to make no progress with a case." But th=
