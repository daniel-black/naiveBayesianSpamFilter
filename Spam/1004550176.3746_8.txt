Chitosan is a compound with unique fat absorbing 
properties. It is derived from chitin, which is found in the 
exoskeletons of shellfish, chemically similar to plant
 fibers, chitosan cannot be digested by the human body. 
Once activated in the stomach, chitosan binds to 
some fatty acids and carries them through the digestive 

system without being absorbed, this helps reduce the 

amount of fat calories digested by the body. Chitosan 

works with your body naturally and can be effective 

in helping to eliminate excess fat from your diet.

fibers. It also increases the use of fats as an energy 
source.
