<b>RAPIDLY GROWING INDUSTRY.</b>
<br>
Hold on tight for the largest Oil and Natural Gas expansion in U.S. History.  Demand for Energy is at its
highest level putting tremendous pressure on Scientific & Technical Instrumentation companies like CBYI.
There is rapid expansion in the energy industry with the need for more power plants and cheaper fuel.
CBYI is a major benefactor of this growing need because it supplies specialized "Smell Technology" analyzers
for industrial applications in Natural Gas production and transmission.</p>
