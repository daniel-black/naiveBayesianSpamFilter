Former Dallas Cowboy Jay Novacek, invites you to be a guest on his 3500
acre 
<strong>PRIVATE HUNTING RANCH</strong> in Nebraska.  This beautiful, but
rugged, cedar covered hill country is 
located 30 minutes from North Platte's Lee Bird Field. (Capable of
handling jet air craft)  Or just 
4 hours east of Denver on I-80.  No matter how you choose to arrive, you
will be treated to up to 4 
days of guided hunting for one or more of 20 different native and exotic
big game species.  We also 
feature upland game bird hunting and can get you in touch with some great
duck and goose hunting.
</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=2>
Jay and an experienced group of guides specialize in custom fitting each
hunt 
to the style and preference of each individual hunter.  We offer stands,
spot and stalk, or sneek
hunting.  Just let us know what style and what weapon you want to use.
</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=2>After a hard day in the field, relax in the 20,000 sq
ft "barn."  This mother 
of all hunting lodges is equipped with a hot tub, indoor archery range,
pool table, hunting videos, horse
shoes, indoor basketball court, and a sporting clays range.  If you find
time to eat, (and believe me you 
will want to) Jay's mom does all the cooking and they are the best meals
in the mid-west.
</font></b></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=2>
So join us for a hunting adventure you will always remember.
