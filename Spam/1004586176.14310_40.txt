Dear name owner,

I am contacting you on behalf of CanadaSubmit.ca - A Canadian 
Domain Name Affiliate. (http://www.canadasubmit.ca).

Are you planning on doing business in Canada now or in the future?

Do you want to attract Canadian traffic and commerce to your 
website?

Do you have brand names, corporate names or ideas that you 
would like to protect in Canada?

If so, you should register your .CA domain names as soon as 
possible before someone else does.

The .CA domain was recently made more available to the public.  
Many of the best names, including your name, are still likely available.  
Because the .CA domain is a North American - Country Domain it has been 
estimated that over 3.5 million names will be registered over the next 
36-48 months.

FACT: There will never be a better opportunity to secure your 
names in Canada than right now.

Start by searching for availability at:
http://www.canadasubmit.ca

All prices are in Canadian Dollars.

Regards,
Sandy
