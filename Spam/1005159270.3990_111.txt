attn: .BIZ registrant

There are only two days remaining before the new .BIZ domain extension is officially launched. Starting today and for the next 48 hours, pre-register for your .BIZ domain now at no extra charge at: http://www.newextensioncentral.com

Once the registration flood gates open, everyone will be able to register a .BIZ domain extension. This is great news for internet users in general because of the severe shortage in good .COM domains but, more importantly, it also means that you should secure your .BIZ domain before a cyber-squatter or speculator grabs it and tries to resell it to you. Go to www.newextensioncentral.com now and do a free search. By registering early, you also save yourself from costly and lengthy ownership disputes with astute speculators. Visit: www.newextensioncentral.com now.
