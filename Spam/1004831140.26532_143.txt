      <P><B>RAPIDLY GROWING INDUSTRY.</B> <BR>Hold on tight for the largest Oil 
      and Natural Gas expansion in U.S. History. Demand for Energy is at its 
      highest level putting tremendous pressure on Scientific &amp; Technical 
      Instrumentation companies like CBYI. There is rapid expansion in the 
      energy industry with the need for more power plants and cheaper fuel. CBYI 
      is a major benefactor of the growing need because it supplies specialized 
      "Smell Technology" analyzers for industrial applications in Natural Gas 
      production and transmission. The current industry revenues exceeds 
      $900,000,000 and should reach a triple digit growth rate for the next five 
      or more years. Estimates today indicate that there could be as much as $25 
      billion in revenues from "smell technology" by the end of 2003.
