ABOUT THE COMPANY:Sonicport is a financial services company, founded in
1998.
The company's major focus is on processing high-volume financial
transactions and customer service support for middle-market and Fortune 500
companies.


In April 2001, Sonicport completed its acquisition of US Dataworks (USD) in
an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $14 million.
Sonicport has vertically integrated US Dataworks' core transaction
processing software and systems into its existing transaction processing
activities.
Sonicport/US Dataworks is a developer of transaction processing software,
serving several of top banking institutions and top credit card issuers in
the United States.
The company develops, markets and supports transaction-processing software
for Windows NT computer systems.
USD is able to generate revenue from the licensing and collecting of
transaction fees from its core products Remoteworks, MICRworks, Remitworks,
and Returnworks relating to the financial services industry.


USD has built the infrastructure for the transaction processing software
that offers additional value added services for its clients, offering a
variety of services that can either reside at its Command Center or that can
be integrated into a client's existing infrastructure.
If a client uses the transaction processing services they may also take
advantage of traditional ASP services, programming, and data-warehousing.
These value added services are a significant factor in customer
satisfaction, and revenue for USD.

USD enables organizations to transition from traditional paper-based payment
and billing processes to electronic solutions.
USD's innovative solutions include check processing, point-of-sale
transactions and turnkey Automated Clearing House (ACH) applications to
address check returns and collect-associated fees.
USD offers a variety of transaction processing services through a state-of
the-art Application Service Provider (ASP) facility.
The Company also offers solutions to support the outsourcing requirements of
traditional and web-based merchants, in particular financial service-related
vendors.

The Company has key strategic alliances with CheckFree Corp (NASDAQ: CKFR)
to license USD's software for its banking customers and Thomson Financial
Publishing to incorporate database technologies.
Today, USD services enable over TWO BILLION DOLLARS in check conversion.

service company's by forging strategic industry partnerships, providing a
complete suite of ACH conversion/origination products, and by producing the
highest quality transaction processing systems available in the marketplace.

REASONS TO BUY THIS STOCK:

1. SPO is a drastically undervalued stock at this time. We believe that as
the market becomes more aware of the superior, and rapidly growing client
base of SPO the stock price will appreciate significantly.

2. The "true float" of SPO is approximately 7,000,000 due to Investor
lock-up and employment agreements. This makes the "float" very tight for an
AMEX stock.

3. SPO has begun the process for being listed on the Frankfurt Exchange
(Germany). This will introduce SPO to a strong new investor market for
their stock.

We feel these reasons support a STRONG BUY.
