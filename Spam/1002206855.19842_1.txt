<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Our current company, Pristine
  International Seafood, Inc. (OTC: POYS) is truly deserving of our recommendation.
  We have been following this stock closely, and believe that is positioned to
  become hugely profitable in the $100 million post harvest seafood treatment
  (PHT) industry. <br>
  <br>
  <b><u>The Company<br>
  </u>Pristine International Seafood (OTC: POYS)</b> is a 3yr old company, formerly
  known as Pristine Oyster, Inc. Located in the heart of Florida’s seafood capital,
  the Apalachicola Bay, this emerging growth company has capitalized on a technology
  that purifies an oyster to 99.9% bacteria-free and does not effect the taste
  or texture. POYS processes &amp; markets individually quick-frozen oysters,
  frozen shrimp, fish, scallops, &amp; other seafood as well.<br>
  <br>
  Vibrio, is a form of bacterial poisoning found in shellfish that has caused
  numerous deaths and illness. This July, the ISSC (the regulatory board for all
  interstate shellfish shipping) <b>mandated</b> a 40% reduction in Vibrio related
  illnesses by 2006. If not met, a series of regulations take effect. The goal
  is to reduce Vibrio related illnesses by 40% for the years 2005/2006 (average)
  and 60% for the years 2007/2008.<br>
  <br>
  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">POYS' cryogenic process not
  only kills the bacteria to a 99.9% bacteria-free level, but also lengthens shelf-life
  from 14 days (the time raw shucked oysters are allowed to stay on the market)
  to about 14 months. The FDA has approved their technology of cryogenic freezing,
  which <b>allows Pristine to supply vendors such as Restaurant Chains, Casinos,
  and Cruise ships all year long.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>POYS quick freezes at minus
  50 degrees &amp; then seals the oysters with a water mist to lock in moisture.
  The processed oysters can still carry the &quot;raw&quot; designation preferred
  by the consumer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Only 4 other companies exist
  in the United States that cryogenically purify oysters. <b>Pristine is the only
  and single-largest oyster processing plant in Florida.</b> It is successfully
  selling product processed with its new technology, &amp; its sales have been
  growing at a very attractive rate. In 1999, sales were about $700,000. In 2000,
  they increased <br>
  to about $2,200,000. <b>This year, sales are projected to reach $6,000,000!<br>
  <br>
  </b>Pristine Seafood (OTC:POYS) officially opened its new state-of-the-art processing
  facility in February 2001. The move positioned Pristine to continue its dramatic
  growth while taking advantage of major cost savings, increasing production capabilities
  and lowering operational costs. Pristine expects operational savings of approximately
  $250,000.<br>
  <br>
  In addition, the company announced on September 26</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><sup>th</sup></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">
  that it had entered into a brokering agreement with McCrea Marketing, Inc. McCrea,
  with over 12 yrs experience, will represent Pristine to large distributors and
  to the military. The added representation is projected to increase sales by
  20% over the next 24 months, which means sales could easily <br>
  exceed $10,000,000<br>
  <br>
  <b><u>Investment Opportunity<br>
  </u></b>Pristine has a 5% market share of the existing PHT market. With the
  new plant facility, <b>Pristine has the production capacity to capture 25% or
  more of the new market or approximately $25,000,000 in sales of PHT oysters.
  </b>The current production rate for all PHT oysters is less than 5% of the existing
  fresh market. When these new regulations<br>
  are in place, the available market will expand to approximately $100,000,000
  per year. Efficiency and an expanding PHT market should allow POYS’ <b>revenues
  to SOAR!<br>
