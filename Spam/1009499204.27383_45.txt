The new .NAME domain will be officially launched in early 2002, so this means you have only a few weeks to pre-register for your very own personal .NAME. The new domains are becoming very popular because they may be used as international personal identifiers for mobile communications, similar to a social security number. For more information, visit: www.namesforeveryone.com.

According to Andrew Tsia, CEO of Global Name Registry, "In the near future, a .NAME address could even serve as your cell phone number and  your online identity to handle money transfers!"

There are a lot of potential applications for this new domain name. But one thing is for sure, these domains will easily become the definitive personal domain name on the Internet that consumers have been waiting years for. There is a unique .NAME for everyone, so visit http://www.namesforeveryone.com now.

It's the most personalized domain that is currently offered on the Internet.  For example, if your name is John Smith, you can reserve John.Smith.name as well as get your personalized email  John@Smith.name.  Use it to create your own personal website for posting pictures, hobbies, interests, or even resumes. You can also replace a hard to remember email address like yourname45@mail99.com with your firstname@lastname.name.  Your name will never change, so why not pre-register now before someone else does? The uses for your .NAME are endless! If you still prefer a conventional business-type domain name, you can also register one of the new .BIZ and .INFO domain names at: http://www.namesforeveryone.com/bizinfo
