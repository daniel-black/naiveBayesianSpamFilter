SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT:  All of us at US Goverment Grant Information Publications
are deeply saddened by the tragic events that took place on September 11, 2001.
Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families and everyone
whose lives have been affected by this disaster. 

We would like to show you how you can help rebuild Americas future by taking your first step
in opening a new business or financing an existing one or even go back to school.  The Office of Personnel and Management has revealed over 2,200 jobs are lost each day across the United States.

Now, this may not be your situation, but it is comforting to know that the government
has an incentive program to help you start any type of business you desire in all 50 states,
including Puerto Rico. This program offers government grants to start any type of business
conceivable, plus low interest loans (some require no credit checks or credit history).
Congress has set aside over $3 billion of your tax dollars for new business startups.
The type of business you start is limited only by your imagination:
(Repair Shops, Restaurants, Night Clubs, Weight Loss Nutrition Centers, Health Spas,
Day Care Centers, Computer Retail, Wholesale or Related Services, Research,
Real Estate, Car Wash, Cleaners, Billiard Parlor, Automotive Repair, Motel, Bike Shop),
plus money for starting a business in high unemployment areas.

Donald Trump, Lee Iacocca, and H. Ross Perot used this program to get where they are today.
Our most recent recipient, Mr. Newton of North Carolina, received grants and loans totaling
over $200,000.00 to start a Manufacturing Business.
Ron Brown of Atlanta received $75,000.00 to start a Construction Company.
Diane Jenkins received $50,000.00 to start a 24-Hour Day Care Center and the list goes on.

You too can receive free money to go back to school or to expand an existing business.

Example:  $30,000 in personal items -car payment, house rent, clothing, debits repaid, and goceries!
	  $50,000 to go back to school!

Find out how your government can help you in these troubled times.
