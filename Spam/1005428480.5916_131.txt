Greetings,  
I am Commander Kerbino Kuanyin, the military personnel in charge of 
Energy and mineral resources for The Sudan People's Liberation 
Army/Movement (SPLA) A rebel group fighting for the liberation of the 
Southern Sudanese people, and the leader is Dr Colonel John Garang. 
It might interest you to note that this group came to be in May 1983 
Though the war in Sudan started as early as August 1955. 
 
 From all indication, all our effort to achieve this aim of liberating the 
people proves abortive because of the immortalize act and government 
attack on us and the uncompromising attitude of our co-boarder 
countries recently, really affect our motives of accruing freedom thereby 
embarking on investment. 
 
The recent attitude of our co-boarder countries as mention before 
warranted our decision of stashing our funds with a security company 
within the continent of Africa. The possibility of investing with these 
funds ourselves is highly limited, as we cannot leave Sudan for that 
purpose. In view of this fact, it therefore becomes necessary to contact 
you for the purpose of entrusting the fund in your care for investment. 
 
Kindly revert to me as soon as possible only if you are interested to 
enable me equips you with further details. 
 
 
Yours Sincerely. 
 
CDR. KERBINO KUANYIN
