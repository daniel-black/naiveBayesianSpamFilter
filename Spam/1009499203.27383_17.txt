Conducted by the well known <b><u>University of Advanced Research - Hawaii Campus</b></u>, the IERP free tuition program will determine if the average adult, with average responsibilities can complete the required course of study for a graduate degree within 18 to 20 weeks from his or her home.  With 3.5 hours of daily study, a student could complete the learning portion of the program within 18 weeks, in preparation for the sturdy final examination.  <u>You may take up to four-years to complete the program if you choose</u>.

The regular tuition is $700.00.  <u><b>You are not required to pay tuition</u></b> to participate in the research project nor are you required to have an undergraduate degree (the usual requirement).  You will earn the same respected credential that our other graduate students earn upon completion of the 9 courses and proctored final examination.</font></p>

We have graduates in at least two branches of the U.S. Military. Several foreign dignitaries, to include at least one Ambassador have graduated from our Master's Degree program.  After more than 10 years of worldwide dedication to academics, the university has students and graduates in the United States, Africa, Antigua, Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, England, Germany, Israel, Japan, Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia, Netherlands, Panama, Puerto Rico, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sweden, Taiwan and Vietnam. 
Although the university is unaccredited at this time, that has had little to no effect on the acceptability of <u>degrees earned by our students</u></b>.  The primary reason is that <u>a professor from an accredited college or university teaches to you his or her specialty in each of the 9 On-Line courses in the discipline. Therefore, it is impossible to argue the quality of the education; our method of delivery is more convenient than 99% of all Master's Programs in existence.</b></u>. You will join a global Alumnus family of Master's in Business Administration. Our school is well known and so are its curricula (our global classroom spans over 25 countries with a substantial student body).  The university has educated entire families and approximately one out of every five new students is a referral from an existing student or graduate.  Of the employers and recruiters that inquire daily about our graduates, 99.99% of them never ask for more than the applicant's enrollment date, graduation date and informa
on about the curriculum. Two of the world's most outstanding universities, Cambridge and Oxford are unaccredited and  operate via Royal Charter.  We are certainly in good company.  </font></p></font></p>


<p align="left"><FONT face="times roman" color=lightgray size=4><b><u>Why Should You <br>Earn Your Master's Degree?</b></u>:<ul><i></font>

<FONT face="times roman" color=lightgray size=4>

<p align="justify"><FONT face="times new roman" color=black size=6>Y<FONT face="arial narrow" color=black size=3>ou open a world of professional and income opportunities.  You speak well, write better and present yourself to others with greater pride and self-confidence. A new skills set drives you to posture your life for advancement.</p></font></ul>

<ul><p align="justify"><FONT face="times new roman" color=black size=6>T<FONT face="arial narrow" color=black size=3>he predominant cause of divorce in the United States is not infidelity; it is insurmountable financial difficulty.  Certainly, overspending and poor budgeting contribute to the monetary demise of else wise successful families.  However, experts in the subject matter conclude that limited education is substantially the cause of poor financial management. You expound on this research by hypothecating that increased education in the areas of finance, economics and business would reduce the probability of failure in these areas... would increase the probability of higher pay... would reduce the probability of poor financial management... would reduce the probability of divorce.  Limited education is, according to top academics, researchers and scientist, the primary factor in violent crimes, domestic violence and dysfunctional relationships.  When you pursue higher education, you improve your cha
es of success in nearly all areas of your life.</p></font></ul>

<ul><i></font><FONT face="times roman" color=lightgray size=4>
<ul>2. You help others...

<p align="justify"><FONT face="times new roman" color=black size=6>P<FONT face="arial narrow" color=black size=3>arents that did not attend college are more likely to have children who will not attend college.  As parents, we are (or should be) the role models for our children.  Children do exactly as they see us do (or not do) and tend to become mirror images of us (reflecting our values and beliefs). They are the products of their environment and will carry these implanted images of life, ability, morality and ethics into the world.  Of course, this is not true in all situations.  We must lead by example if we are to prepare our children for the realities of life.  As is the case with a parent that smokes, it is difficult to convince your child that smoking is a dangerous and lethal health hazard. The same analogy applies to education.  If you did not earn your degree, what can you tell your child that will make a difference or that will encourage him or her to strive for the worthiest of goals... a colle
degree?  Are you leading by example?  Does poverty encourage children to go to college? In some cases yes; in all others, it begets more poverty.  Allowing your children to watch you as you study our online courses, sends a message..."Mom or Dad is in college." That irrefutable self cognition will outlive your warnings of limited career opporunity and poverty.</p></font></ul></ul></ul></li></li>

Some have less than perfect access to the internet.   The online courses allow you to print the chapters and save the videos to your computer's hard-drive.  That way, you can take your school with you on business trips, even poolside.  If you have a single telephone line in your home, offline study is ideal.   Because no modem is required to access the material on your hard drive, you may take advantage of long flights or road trips while watching multimedia presentations in private.   We  give you every opportunity to enjoy the academic experience.  All that we ask is that you do the easy-to-follow course work, study every day, and graduate.

You also receive your Official Transcripts for the work you complete during the

The Provost of the university maintains project statistics separate from your dossier.  <u>If for any reason your application is not accepted, you <b>will not be charged.</b>  The Registrar will send you an email notice that explains the reasons why your application was not processed</u>.  The Registrar allows 3 business days for you to correct the discrepancies noted if you choose to continue with the enrollment process. Ater 3 days, we must award the grant to someone else.
