<p align="center"><b><font size="4">Below is a quote from The Daily News, November 8, 2001. 
(page8)</font></b></p>
<p align="center">&quot;Research is underway at Brigham Young University, where a 
silver compound is under serious study as an all purpose drug.&nbsp; Comparisons 
of the silver compound to the common antibiotic tetracycline showed the silver 
worked as well or better against 11 germs, scientist say.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">Colloidal Silver was the antibiotic of choice in the early 
1900's, however penicillin won out among pharmacies and the silver (which 
worked far better) was squashed.&nbsp; The reason being, colloidal silver is 
easy to make and penicillin is not.&nbsp; In other words, because Penicillin 
could be controlled and sold for more profit, the better substance was hidden.</p>
<p align="center">Only now, when too many lives are at stake is the truth 
resurfacing about Colloidal Silver.&nbsp; Please do not forego a doctors care, however every home should have Colloidal 
Silver in the medicine cabinet for three reasons.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="center">1.&nbsp; It may soon be considered a drug and prescriptions 
will be necessary.</p>
<p align="center">2. Your body may become immune to prescription antibiotics, 
but will not become immune to Silver.</p>
<p align="center">3. It should be taken daily as a supplement</p>
